### Exposition of Commentary on *Tattva Mukta Kalapa*, Verses 64-65

This section of K.S. Varadacharya’s commentary addresses a profound set of challenges concerning the nature of the liberated state (*mukti*) within the Viśiṣṭādvaita tradition. It begins by clarifying the multifaceted definition of liberation and then confronts two difficult objections regarding how a liberated, omniscient soul can remain blissful while being aware of suffering.

#### Part 1: The Problem of Perceiving a Suffering World

First, the commentator addresses a foundational query directed at a "devotee delighting in the joy of service (*dāsya-sukha-rasika*)." The objection highlights an apparent contradiction in the Viśiṣṭādvaita concept of liberation (*mokṣa*). How can liberation be simultaneously described as:
1.  The full manifestation of the self’s true nature (*svarūpa-āvirbhāva*),
2.  The experience of the infinite bliss of Brahman (*niravadhika-ānanda-brahma-anubhava*),
3.  A state of eternal service (*sevā-rūpa*), and
4.  A state of supreme independence (*svātantryam*), as suggested by the scripture, "he becomes his own ruler (*saḥ svarāṭ bhavati*)"?

Is your conception of liberation, the objector asks, just a paradoxical mixture of disparate elements?

The commentator readily agrees: "Yes, it is. What can we do? Those who rely on the cleverness of their own intellect and the force of logic may invent a final human goal (*parama-puruṣārtha*) that satisfies them. But we, as followers of the Vedas (*vaidikāḥ*), do not have the authority to invent such things. We simply accept what the scriptures (*śruti*) tell us."

The commentary then harmonizes these elements. The manifestation of the self’s true nature is indeed liberation. This occurs, as scripture states, through "attaining" (*saṃpadyate*) the Supreme Self. The essential nature (*svarūpa*) of the individual self (*jīva*) is to be exclusively subordinate (*śeṣa*) to the Supreme Self (*paramātman*). The commentator pointedly remarks to the objector, "You, however, do not even grasp the secret of your own teacher’s words: 'O Śambhu, even if the distinction [between us] were to cease, I am yours; you are not mine.'" We, on the other hand, do understand this. It is for this reason that we describe the ultimate human goal as one that contains all these meanings. This rich understanding also informs the interpretation of the Brahma Sūtra "And because of the indication of mere equality in enjoyment" (IV.4.21, *bhogamātrasāmyaliṅgācca*), which is explained by analogy with the "prince who was lost and found" (*rājakumāra-nyāya*), affirming that liberation is a rediscovery of one's innate, glorious relationship to Brahman.

Having established this ground, the commentator introduces the main argument of Vedanta Desika’s verse:

> **Verse 64:** **[For the liberated soul, everything is favorable].**
> The inherent favorability (*ānukūlya*) of the entire universe, which has Vāsudeva as its Self, becomes fully manifest at the time of liberation, due to the removal of the contraction of knowledge caused by worldly existence (*bhava*).

**The Objection Elaborated:**

A significant problem arises concerning the liberated soul’s omniscience. If, in the state of liberation (*mukti*), knowledge encompasses all things, then the liberated must be aware of everything in this world. This world, being a product of the three qualities of nature (*triguṇa-kāryatvāt*), is inherently constituted of pleasure, pain, and delusion (*sukha-duḥkha-moha-ātmakam*).

This leads to a severe dilemma:
1.  If the liberated perceive this world as it is, they would surely be affected by its pains and delusions themselves.
2.  If they are aware of the suffering but remain indifferent (*udāsīnāḥ*), they would be cruel (*nṛśaṃsāḥ*) or lack a true understanding of the Self’s presence in all beings (*sārvātmya-jñāna-śūnyāḥ*).
3.  Just as knowing the blissful Brahman makes one blissful, knowing suffering should make one suffer. If they *don't* know suffering, their omniscience (*sarvajñatva*) is compromised.
4.  If they perceive suffering *as* pleasure, this would be a form of false knowledge (*anyathājñāna*), which is impossible for a liberated being.

This presents a double-bind (*ubhayataḥpāśā rajjuḥ*), seemingly trapping the doctrine in a contradiction.

**The Resolution:**

The commentary resolves this by radically re-framing the nature of reality from the liberated perspective.

The entire universe, which has Vāsudeva as its Self (*vāsudevātmakasya jagataḥ*), is *intrinsically* favorable (*ānukūlyam eva svataḥ*). This is its natural, inherent state, even here in the world of bondage (*saṃsāre'pi*). This innate favorability becomes fully manifest (*vyaktim bhajati*) at the time of liberation (*muktikāle*). This happens because the contraction of knowledge caused by karma (*karma-kṛta-jñāna-saṅkocasya*) is completely removed.

The argument rests on a principle accepted by all and confirmed by experience: suffering arises from cognizing things as unfavorable (*pratikūlatva-jñāna*), while happiness arises from cognizing them as favorable (*anukūlatva-jñāna*). The truth is that this entire world has Brahman as its Self (*brahmātmakam*), as is established by scriptural authorities like, "All this is indeed Brahman" (*sarvaṃ khalvidaṃ brahma* - Chāndogya Up. 3.14.1) and the Mahābhārata which states, "The senses, mind, intellect, existence, energy, strength, and fortitude—they declare all these to be of the nature of Vāsudeva, as are the field (body) and the knower of the field (the self)."

In the state of bondage (*saṃsāra-daśā*), one's knowledge is constricted by karma, preventing one from seeing the world as having Brahman as its Self. This is precisely why one experiences suffering. In liberation, however, with karma completely eradicated, the liberated soul perceives the entire universe as it truly is: having Brahman as its Self. Consequently, the very possibility of perceiving anything as unfavorable (*prātikulyajñānasya eva abhāvāt*) disappears. Since the natural state of things is favorability, only happiness results. Thus, there is not even a trace of suffering.

**A Counter-Objection:**

But wait, the objector might say. Isn't it universally accepted that the world is a mixture of pleasure, pain, and delusion as a product of *prakṛti*'s evolution? If you claim its inherent nature is only pleasurable and that suffering is merely circumstantial (*aupādhikam*), aren't you just presenting a mirror image of the Buddhist who claims "All is suffering" (*sarvaṃ duḥkham*)? Are you not, in effect, denying the world's tri-fold nature of pleasure, pain, and delusion?

**The Refinement:**

The commentator responds: No, the concepts of favorability and unfavorability are relative (*āpekṣike*). The liberated soul (*mukta*) is beyond the three *guṇas* and is trans-worldly (*alaukika*). Indeed, even one who seeks liberation (*mumukṣu*) begins to live as if beyond the world. We do not deny the world's nature as a mix of pleasure, pain, and delusion. The key is that not everything is the same for everyone.

The statement in the Yoga Sūtras (2.15), "To the discerning person, all is suffering (*sarvam eva duḥkhaṃ vivekinaḥ*)," uses the particle *eva* ("indeed" or "only") to emphasize the connection, not to exclude everything else. So, while the world has this mixed nature, its perception is contingent on the viewer.

If you argue that the liberated soul, in seeing everything as favorable, must be under an illusion (*bhrānti*), that is incorrect. The world's nature as pleasure, pain, and delusion is defined *from the perspective of the bound soul* (*saṃsāri-jīva-dṛṣṭyā*), not from the perspective of the liberated. If it were otherwise, then the Supreme Self (*paramātman*), who is also omniscient, would inevitably have to experience suffering, which is absurd. It is universally accepted that pleasure and pain are rooted in karma. Since the liberated have no karma, the possibility of suffering does not arise for them.

#### Part 2: The Problem of Remembering Past Suffering

The argument now advances to a more personal and difficult challenge.

> **Verse 65:** That liberated soul will not suffer at that time from the knowledge of the way in which things were previously unfavorable, because even in the past, this [unfavorability] was caused exclusively by God’s displeasure, which was itself conditioned by that soul’s own karma.

**The New Objection:**

Even if we grant the previous points, the liberated souls were once bound. In that state, they may have experienced hell and other forms of suffering. In their now-omniscient state, do they remember this past suffering or not?

This creates another dilemma:
1.  If they do not remember, their omniscience is incomplete.
2.  If they do remember, the memory of that past suffering will inevitably cause them pain now.
3.  If they remember that past suffering as something favorable, it constitutes false knowledge (*anyathājñāna*), which is impossible for a liberated soul.

What is the resolution (*kaḥ samādhiḥ*) to this?

**The Final Resolution:**

Vedanta Desika’s verse provides the answer. The liberated soul (*eṣaḥ*) does not become afflicted with suffering (*na duḥkhyet*) at the time of liberation (*tadānīm*) due to the memory (*dhiyā*) of the sequence of past unfavorability (*prācīnaḥ yaḥ prātikūlyasya kramaḥ*).

Why not? Because even in the past (*prāgapi*), the fact that things were a cause of suffering was not due to their intrinsic nature. Rather, it was caused *exclusively* by God’s punitive justice or displeasure (*bhagavat-nigraha*), which in turn was conditioned by one’s own sinful karma (*svakarma-upādhi-kṛta*).

The liberated souls, being omniscient, know this complete truth. They understand that the cause of their past suffering was not inherent in the objects or events themselves, but was rooted in their own sinful actions (*svakṛta-pāpa-mūlaka*) which prompted God’s displeasure. In the state of liberation, causes like divine displeasure no longer exist. Therefore, even with the full knowledge of past suffering, it does not produce any new suffering.

The commentator provides a powerful analogy: a person suffering from a bile disorder (*pittadoṣa*) experiences the taste of milk as bitter. After being cured, they may remember this experience, thinking, "Ah, that bitter taste was caused by my illness." But do they re-experience the bitter taste merely by remembering it? Of course not.

In the same way, for the liberated, their very omniscience (*sarvajñatva*) becomes the medicine (*auṣadha*) that cures them of all forms of suffering. Therefore, there is never any possibility of pain for the liberated.

The commentator concludes this section with a pastoral warning. All these objections are merely a web of speculation (*kevala-buddhi-kṛta-kalpanā-jāla-mātram*) born from our current unfamiliarity with the true nature of liberation. They are addressed for the sake of those with simple minds, in keeping with the principle, "one should not cause confusion in the minds of the ignorant" (*na buddhibhedaṃ janayet*). Those who wish for their own welfare should stay far away from such useless inquiries—like "examining a crow’s teeth" (*kākadanta-parīkṣā*). Instead, the steadfast should focus on the path of spiritual practice, meditating only on what is auspicious. These intricate arguments are offered for the benefit of those who have been deluded by rationalists (*haitukaiḥ*), not for true devotees (*bhakta-janān*).
