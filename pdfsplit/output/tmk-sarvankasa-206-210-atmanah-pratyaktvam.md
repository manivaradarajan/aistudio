### An Exposition of Verse 77 and its Commentary from the *Tattvamuktākalāpa*

This passage offers a rigorous philosophical analysis of "selfhood" or "inwardness" (*pratyaktvam*), defending the view that the pure self (*ātman*) is the true referent of the word "I" (*ahamartha*). It proceeds by defining key terms, refuting opposing views, and resolving apparent contradictions through careful distinctions.

The argument begins with the verse itself:

> Some define inwardness (*pratyaktvam*) in a person as merely being the substrate of a cognition that has itself as its object. But since the self's self-established nature is already proven, it is more fitting to say that inwardness is the state of shining by itself, for itself.
>
> That very inward self (*pratyaṅ*), with respect to itself, is known by others from their own perspectives as "you" or "this one." Anything that shines for another, whether it be inert or not-inert, is rightly considered an outward object (*parāgartha*).

**1. Defining "Inwardness" (*Pratyaktvam*)**

The commentary first unpacks the different philosophical positions on what constitutes the "inwardness" of the self.

**A. The Opponent's Initial Definition (The Vaiśeṣika View)**

The verse begins by presenting a view held by "some" (*kecit*), identified by the commentator as schools like the Vaiśeṣikas who deny that the self is self-luminous. They propose a functional definition: inwardness is **simply the state of being the substrate for a cognition that takes oneself as its object** (*svaviṣayadhiṣaṇādhāratāmātram*).

In this view, the self is not inherently self-aware. Instead, it is the entity that says, "I know myself." The "inwardness" lies in the fact that the knower and the known are the same entity, but this knowing still requires a separate act of cognition. The difference between a self and an inert object like a pot is that a pot is only ever an object of knowledge (*jñeya*), whereas a self is a knower (*jñātṛ*) who can also become its own object of knowledge.

**B. The Author's Refutation and Refined Definition**

The commentator rejects this definition as inadequate. The author’s own school holds that the self is self-proven and self-luminous (*svataḥsiddha*), a doctrine established in a previous verse. The self doesn't require a separate act of knowledge to be known, any more than a lamp requires another lamp to be seen. Its very nature is to shine or be manifest. As scripture states, "Here, this person is self-luminous" (*atrāyaṃ puruṣaḥ svayaṃ jyotiḥ*).

Given this self-luminosity, the initial definition is insufficient. The commentator then refines the concept. One might think inwardness is simply self-luminosity (*svato bhāsamānatvam*), but this is also not quite right. In Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy, the self's consciousness, known as attributive knowledge (*dharmabhūtajñāna*), is also self-luminous. Yet, this consciousness is not considered the "inward" self; it serves the self.

Therefore, the correct definition of inwardness (*pratyaktvam*) is more specific: it is **the state of shining by itself and *for itself*** (*svasmai svenaiva bhānaṃ*). The self is not just a locus of self-luminosity; it is the ultimate beneficiary of that luminosity. It is the one *for whom* consciousness shines. This distinguishes the self (*ātman*), which is inward (*pratyak*), from its own consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*), which is considered outward (*parāk*).

**2. The Problem of Perspective: "I" vs. "You"**

An immediate and powerful objection arises: If my nature is to be an "I" (*aham*), why do other people perceive and address me as "you" (*tvam*) or refer to me as "he" or "this person" (*ayam*, *saḥ*)? This suggests that the same entity possesses both inwardness (*pratyaktvam*, its "I-ness" to itself) and outwardness (*parāktvam*, its "you-ness" to others). If "outwardness" is the characteristic of the non-self, doesn't this mean that the entity we call "I" is actually a composite of the pure self and some non-self element (like the body or mind)?

The verse provides the solution: **The self is inward (*pratyaṅ*) only from its own perspective (*svāpekṣayā*)**. From the perspective of others, that very same self is apprehended as an outward object—a "you" or a "this one." "I-ness" is an intrinsically first-person property. This does not imply a contradiction or a composite nature, any more than being "here" from my perspective and "there" from yours makes my location a metaphysical mixture.

**3. Redefining "Outwardness" (*Parāktvam*) and "Inertness" (*Jaḍatvam*)**

The opponent presses the objection further: Isn't "outwardness" (*parāktvam*) synonymous with being inert and material (*jaḍatvam*)? If the self is "outward" from another's point of view, doesn't that make it partly inert?

The commentary refutes this by drawing a crucial distinction, based on the last line of the verse: "Anything that shines for another, whether it be inert or not-inert, is rightly considered an outward object."

The key is to differentiate between "shining for another" and "shining *only* for another."
*   **Outwardness (*parāktvam*)** simply means **shining for another** (*parasmai bhātam*). In this sense, another conscious self is "outward" to me, just as a rock is.
*   **Inertness (*jaḍatvam*)**, however, is a more specific condition: it is the state of **shining *only* for another** (*parasmai eva bhātam*).

An inert object, like a pot, shines only for a conscious observer; it has no awareness of itself. A conscious self, in contrast, while it may shine *for* another (as a "you"), also simultaneously shines *for itself* (as an "I"). Therefore, a self can possess outwardness (*parāktvam*) relative to others without possessing inertness (*jaḍatvam*). This resolves the apparent contradiction. The "I" is not a mixture of conscious and inert principles (*jaḍājaḍamiśraṇa*).

**4. The Core Dispute: Is the Pure Self the Referent of "I"?**

The commentary now turns to the central argument against those (like some Advaitins) who claim that the pure, transcendent self (*ātman*) is *not* the referent of "I" (*ahamartha*). They argue that the "I"-notion is tied to the ego (*ahaṅkāra*) or the mind (*antaḥkaraṇa*), a product of ignorance that must be transcended.

The commentator challenges this view systematically: What exactly does it mean to say "the self is not the *ahamartha*"?

1.  **Does it mean the self does not appear as the object of the "I"-cognition?** This is untenable. Even the opponent's own foundational thinkers, like Śaṅkarācārya, concede that the self is the object of the "I"-cognition (*ahaṃpratyayaviṣayatvāt*).
2.  **Does it mean the self is not inherently inward (*pratyak*)?** This is absurd. Inwardness is the very defining characteristic of the self.
3.  **Does it mean the self is not the entity referred to by the *word* "I"?** This contradicts universal linguistic practice. Every person uses the word "I" to refer to their own self.

The opponent might point to common expressions like "I am fat" (*ahaṃ sthūlaḥ*) as proof that the "I"-notion includes the body, an inert entity. The commentator dismisses this as the confusion of unenlightened worldly people (*saṃsāriṇām*). This is a case of misattribution (*adhyāsa*), where properties of the body are superimposed on the self. It does not reflect the true nature of the self as experienced by the wise.

The commentary concludes this section with a powerful analogy: The ego or mind (*antaḥkaraṇa*) appears to be conscious and to feel like an "I" only because it is infused with the consciousness of the true self, just as a piece of iron becomes hot and burns only because it is infused with fire. To then claim that the mind is the "I" but the self is not, is as illogical as saying, "The iron burns, but fire itself does not."

**5. The Ultimate Scriptural Proof**

Finally, the commentator provides the ultimate scriptural authority from the Chāndogya Upaniṣad's teaching on *Bhūmavidyā*. Sanatkumāra teaches that knowledge of the self leads one beyond sorrow ("The knower of the self crosses over sorrow"). In this discourse, the ultimate reality, Brahman (*bhūman*), is first described as all-encompassing ("He is below... He is all this"). Then, crucially, this all-encompassing reality is identified with the "I" ("Now, therefore, the teaching concerning the I... I am below... I am all this"). Finally, this "I" is explicitly identified with the self ("Now, therefore, the teaching concerning the Self... the Self is below... the Self is all this").

The logical structure of this scripture—sandwiching the teaching of "I" (*ahaṅkārādeśa*) between the teachings of Brahman and the Self (*ātmādeśa*)—demonstrates conclusively that the true referent of "I" (*ahamartha*) is the ultimate, pure self.

**Conclusion**

The commentary concludes by making a final, clarifying distinction between three related concepts:
*   *ahaṃpadārthatva*: Being the referent of the *word* "I".
*   *ahamarthatva*: The state of *being* the self designated by "I".
*   *ahaṃtva*: The intrinsic property of "I-ness" or inwardness, which is the self's very nature.

This "I-ness" is an undeniable, persistent reality, even in states like deep sleep where the word "I" is not used. Therefore, the ultimate spiritual goal, liberation (*mokṣa*), is not the annihilation of the "I," but rather the realization of its true, unlimited nature—the expansion and perfection of the *ahamartha*.
