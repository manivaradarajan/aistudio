### Exposition of the Argument on the Nature of the Self as both Consciousness and Knower

#### The Opening Challenge: Is the Self Redundant?

An objection is raised against our position. According to our school, there exists an eternal consciousness or intellect (*dhī*), which is an attribute of the self. This consciousness is not static; it is capable of expanding and contracting, flowing out through the sense organs (*indriya*) to make contact with various objects in the world.

The objector poses a pointed question: If you already accept such a powerful, eternal, and dynamic entity—this consciousness (*dhī*)—which can account for all cognitive activity, why do you then insist on positing an additional entity, the self (*ātmā*), to serve as its substrate? By having this active consciousness do all the work, you have rendered the self that supposedly possesses it entirely superfluous. It becomes, in the classic analogy, as useless as the fleshy wattle on a goat’s neck (*ajāgalasthastana*), which looks like an udder but serves no function. Why, the objector asks, should we accept such a redundant entity in our philosophical system?

This objection is rooted in the principle of logical parsimony (*lāghava*). The opponent argues that we can explain all phenomena of knowing with a single substance: an eternal, changing consciousness. Positing a second substance—the self as the knower (*jñātā*)—is an unnecessary complication.

#### The Initial Response: The Authority of Scripture over Parsimony

To this, the verse replies directly. If the nature of the self (*ātmatattva*) were something to be established purely through logical construction or inference (*kalpyaṃ cet*), then indeed, the appeal to logical parsimony (*lāghava*) would be appropriate and justified. In such a scenario, the simpler explanation would be the better one.

However, this is not our situation. For us, as followers of Vedānta, the nature of reality is established by scripture (*nigama*). The very same scriptures that reveal the existence of an eternal consciousness (*sā dhīḥ nityā*) also reveal the existence of a self who possesses this consciousness (*tadvān api*). Both the eternal attribute-knowledge and the self who is its locus are given to us by revelation. Therefore, for one who accepts this scriptural authority, the charge of theoretical "heaviness" or complexity (*gauravam*) is not a burden (*na bhāraḥ*) that can invalidate the position. The debate over logical parsimony only arises when there are multiple viable options. Where scripture is decisive, such a debate has no standing.

#### The Deeper Philosophical Problem: How Can Consciousness Possess Consciousness?

This scriptural response, however, opens the door to the true, underlying philosophical problem (*mūlabhūtā samasyā*), a persistent headache for philosophers. The universal, innate desire of every self is, "May I always be happy" (*ahaṃ sadā sukhī syām*). In this desire, the entity referred to as "I" (*aham*) is the core, self-aware subject (*pratyagvastu*) at the root of all experience.

Vedāntins hold that this "I" is self-luminous (*svaprakāśa*), meaning its nature is to be conscious. It is, in its very essence, knowledge (*jñānasvarūpa*). Yet our experience, such as "I am possessed of knowledge" (*ahaṃ jñānavān*), clearly indicates that knowledge is also an attribute (*dharma*) that the self possesses. This leads to a paradox: the self is a substance that *is* knowledge, and it simultaneously *has* knowledge as an attribute. How is this possible? One does not find a color residing on another color; an attribute like color resides on a substance, like a pot. How, then, can knowledge reside in a substance that is itself knowledge?

#### A Survey of Alternative Solutions from Indian Philosophy

To resolve this crisis, the great minds (*mahāmedhāvinaḥ*) of India’s philosophical traditions have labored extensively.

1.  **The Mādhyamika Buddhist Solution: Denial of the Self (*Nairātmyavāda*)**
    The Mādhyamika school of Buddhism argues that the very concept of a permanent self is incoherent. They reason as follows: When an instance of knowledge arises, does the self (*ātman*) undergo a change or modification (*vikṛti*)? If it does, it cannot be eternal, just as a pot that changes is impermanent. If, on the other hand, the self remains utterly unchanged (*avikṛti*) when knowledge arises, then it cannot be the knower (*pramātā*). A being that is identical before and after a cognitive event cannot be said to have performed the act of knowing. Therefore, they conclude, there is no stable self. The entire triad of knower, known, and knowledge (*tripuṭī*) is ultimately empty (*śūnya*), and the pursuit of liberation is the realization of this selflessness (*nairātmya*).

2.  **The Naiyāyika-Vaiśeṣika Solution: Adventitious Consciousness (*Āgantukacaitanyavāda*)**
    In response to the Buddhists, the logicians (*tārkikas*) argue for a radical distinction (*atyantaṃ bheda*) between the self and consciousness. For them, the self is an eternal substance, but consciousness is merely a temporary, adventitious quality that arises when the self comes into contact with the mind and senses. The self in its natural state, as in deep sleep, is non-conscious. They argue that just as the destruction of a pot on the ground does not affect the ground itself, the arising and passing of consciousness does not alter the underlying substance of the self. This preserves the self’s permanence while accounting for the transient nature of cognition.

3.  **The Sāṃkhya and Advaita Vedānta Solution: A Featureless Self**
    Fearing the implication that any change would render the self impermanent, these schools posit a self that is utterly featureless (*nirviśeṣa*) and changeless. The common experience "I know" is explained not as a real property of the self, but as a result of superimposition (*aupādhika*). For Sāṃkhya, it is the reflection of consciousness (*cit*) onto the intellect (*antaḥkaraṇa*). For Advaita Vedānta, this phenomenal experience is ultimately illusory (*mithyā*). In both views, the self remains pristine and untouched by the modifications of knowing, which belong to the mind or intellect, just as a clear crystal appears red due to the proximity of a red flower without itself becoming red.

4.  **The Mīmāṃsā Solution: An Eternal, Yet Changing, Self**
    The philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa takes a different, more robust tack. He accepts that the self undergoes real modification or change (*anyathābhāvaḥ*). However, he argues that modification (*vikāritva*) is not synonymous with destruction (*uccheda*). Change is simply a property of the enduring substance. Thus, for him, there is no contradiction between being eternal and being subject to change.

This brings the objector’s point back with renewed force: if a thinker as rigorous as Kumārila can account for experience with a single, eternal, yet changing conscious substance, why does our school insist on two—the self as a conscious substance (*dharmin*) and its attribute-knowledge (*dharma*)?

#### The Foundational Reply: Embodied Consciousness and the Five-Fold Self

Here, the commentator reveals that the initial, terse reliance on scripture was a placeholder for a much deeper argument. The true motivation for our school’s position lies in solving a fundamental problem of experience that other schools fail to address adequately: the nature of embodied self-awareness.

How do we account for the immediate, non-inferential experience "I am thin" or "I am in this room"? The standard analogy of the "hot iron ball" (*taptāyopiṇḍa*), where the fire's heat pervades the iron, is insufficient. In our system, the self (*jīva*) is atomic (*aṇu*), while its attribute-knowledge (*dharmabhūtajñāna*) pervades the entire body. The problem is that this attribute-knowledge is outward-directed (*parāk*), designed to illuminate external objects. How can it generate the inward-facing, self-referential consciousness (*pratyaktva*) that makes one feel "I *am* this body"?

The key to the solution lies in a correct reading of the *Taittirīya Upaniṣad*'s doctrine of the five sheaths (*pañcakośa*). These layers—the material (*annamaya*), the vital (*prāṇamaya*), the mental (*manomaya*), the intellectual (*vijñānamaya*), and the blissful (*ānandamaya*)—are not merely pedagogical devices or illusory coverings. They represent the ontological structure of the embodied self. The cosmic process of creation (*sṛṣṭi*) culminates in the human being (*puruṣa*), who integrates all these prior levels of existence.

Therefore, the self is not a simple, monolithic entity. It is a composite being that is, in a real sense, constituted by all these layers. The scriptural verse "You are thus situated five-fold: as the material self (*bhūtātmā*), the sensory self (*indriyātmā*), the intellectual self (*buddhyātmā*), the individual self (*jīvātmā*), and the supreme Self (*paramātmā*)" points to this reality.

This understanding resolves the problem of embodied I-consciousness. The feeling "I am this body" is not an error or a mere superimposition. It is a veridical experience because the self-luminous "I" (*pratyagartha*) truly does extend through and is constituted by its material dimension (*bhūtātmā*). The self-as-substance (*dharmijñāna*) itself accounts for this immanent, embodied self-awareness.

However, this does not make attribute-knowledge (*dharmabhūtajñāna*) redundant. While the composite nature of the self explains self-awareness *within the body*, the perception of external objects like a pot still requires the faculty of attribute-knowledge to extend outwards through the senses. Thus, both are necessary: the self as a complex, conscious substance explains our embodied identity, and its attribute-knowledge explains our perception of the external world. The initial objection is thereby answered not by denying parsimony, but by demonstrating the necessity of both entities to account for the full range of human experience.
