Here is an exposition of the philosophical argument, following the principles outlined.

### For the Liberated Soul, Everything is Favorable

**Verse 65:**
For the liberated soul, the entire universe, which is intrinsically the body of Vāsudeva, is perceived as completely favorable. This inherent favorability becomes fully manifest at the time of liberation, once the contraction of knowledge caused by worldly existence (*bhavakṛtajñānasaṅkoca*) is eliminated. At that time, the liberated soul is not pained by the memory of past unfavorable experiences, because they understand that even in the past, this adversity was caused solely by the Lord’s disciplinary action (*bhagavannigraha*), which was itself conditioned by their own karma.

### Commentary

This section addresses another potential objection regarding the state of liberation (*mukti*) in this philosophical system.

**An Objection is Raised:**
It has been established that in the state of liberation, knowledge becomes all-encompassing. If this is so, then the liberated souls must know everything that exists in this world. This universe, being a product of the three cosmic qualities (*triguṇa*), is inherently constituted of pleasure, pain, and delusion (*sukhaduḥkhamohātmakam*). Therefore, in perceiving this world, wouldn’t the liberated souls themselves become afflicted by pleasure, pain, and delusion?

A dilemma arises from this. If they perceive the suffering in the world and remain indifferent, they would be cruel. Alternatively, their knowledge of the all-pervading Self must be incomplete. Just as it is said that one becomes blissful by knowing the blissful Absolute (*ānandamaya-brahman*), it follows that one would also become sorrowful by perceiving sorrow. If, to avoid this, you claim they do not know suffering at all, then their omniscience is compromised. And if you claim they perceive suffering as happiness, then their knowledge is erroneous, which would disqualify them from being considered truly liberated. This seems to be a rope with a noose at both ends (*ubhayataḥ pāśā rajjuḥ*).

**Resolution:**
The solution lies in understanding the true nature of the universe. For the entirety of this world, which has Vāsudeva as its very self (*vāsudevātmakasya*), favorability (*ānukūlyam*) is its intrinsic, natural state (*svataḥ*), even here in the state of worldly bondage (*saṃsāra*). This inherent favorability, however, only achieves full manifestation (*vyakti*) at the time of liberation. This happens because the contraction of knowledge, which was caused by karma (*karmakṛtajñānasaṅkoca*), is completely removed.

It is a universally accepted and empirically verified fact that sorrow arises from the knowledge of something as unfavorable (*pratikūla*), while happiness arises from the knowledge of it as favorable (*anukūla*). That this entire universe is, in its essence, the Absolute (*brahmātmakam*) is established by numerous authoritative texts, such as "All this is indeed Brahman" (*sarvaṃ khalvidaṃ brahma*) from the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, and the Mahābhārata’s declaration that "the senses, mind, intellect, life-force, energy, strength, and fortitude—they are said to have Vāsudeva as their Self, as are the field (body) and the knower of the field (the soul)."

In the state of worldly existence (*saṃsāra*), an individual’s knowledge is contracted by karma, preventing them from seeing the world as having Brahman for its Self. It is for this reason alone that they experience suffering. In liberation, however, with the complete cessation of karma, the soul perceives the entire universe as having Brahman for its Self. Consequently, the very possibility of perceiving anything as unfavorable (*prātikulyajñāna*) is eliminated, and thus there is no occasion for suffering. On the contrary, since the knowledge of favorability is natural and inherent, only happiness arises. Therefore, not even a trace of suffering is possible for the liberated soul.

**A Further Objection:**
But wait, one might object. Is it not universally agreed that the world is composed of pleasure, pain, and delusion? After all, this world is a transformation of material nature (*prakṛti*). If you claim that its nature is inherently only pleasure and that its painful aspects are merely conditional (*aupādhikam*), then you are simply offering a different version of the Buddhist doctrine that "everything is suffering" (*sarvaṃ duḥkham*). In doing so, you would have to abandon the established view that the world is constituted by pleasure, pain, and delusion.

**Response to the Further Objection:**
We concede that favorability and unfavorability are relative concepts (*āpekṣike*). However, a liberated soul is beyond the three cosmic qualities (*triguṇātītaḥ*) and is therefore not subject to ordinary worldly experience. For this reason, even one who seeks liberation (*mumukṣu*) behaves as if they are beyond the world. As the Yoga Sūtras state, "To the discerning one, all is suffering" (2.15). The word "all" in this context is meant to exclude exceptions within the category of worldly experience, not to deny the existence of other categories of experience (like pleasure). Thus, we do not deny that the world is constituted by pleasure, pain, and delusion.

The objector might press further: "If this is so, and the liberated soul perceives the entire world as favorable, does this not mean that even the liberated can fall into delusion?"

No, this is not the case. The characterization of the world as a mix of pleasure, pain, and delusion is made from the perspective of a soul bound by worldly existence (*saṃsārijīvadṛṣṭyā*), not from the perspective of a liberated soul (*muktadṛṣṭyā*). If it were otherwise, then following the objector's logic, even the supreme Self, being omniscient, would inevitably experience suffering, which is absurd. It is universally accepted that experiences like pleasure and pain are rooted in karma. Therefore, for the liberated, who are free from karma, there is no possibility of suffering.

**A Final, More Difficult Objection:**
Even so, another problem remains. These souls who are now liberated were once bound. In their past lives, they surely experienced the sufferings of hell and other miseries. Do they remember these experiences in their liberated state or not?

1.  If they do not remember them, then they cannot be omniscient.
2.  If they do remember them, the knowledge of past suffering would inevitably cause them pain now.
3.  If they remember that past suffering as something favorable, their knowledge is erroneous (*anyathājñāna*) and they are not truly liberated.

What is the solution to this impasse?

**The Final Resolution (Explaining the Verse's Second Half):**
The verse itself provides the answer: *prācīna...* The liberated soul is not pained (*na duḥkhyet*) at the time of liberation (*tadānīm*) by the knowledge (*dhiyā*) concerning the past sequence of unfavorable experiences (*prācīnaḥ yaḥ prātikūlyasya kramaḥ*).

Why are they not pained? Because they understand that even in the past (*prāgapi*), the fact that certain things were a source of suffering was not due to the intrinsic nature of those things. Rather, it was caused solely by the Lord’s disciplinary action (*bhagavannigraha*), which was itself prompted by the condition of their own sinful karma (*svakarma-upādhinā kṛtaḥ*).

Liberated souls are, by definition, omniscient. Therefore, they know this truth perfectly: the cause of their past suffering was not the object or event itself, but rather God's disciplinary response to their own misdeeds. In the state of liberation, since there is no longer any such disciplinary action (*nigraha*), knowledge of the past event, even while acknowledging it was painful, does not cause any present suffering.

Consider an analogy: a discerning person who, due to a liver ailment (*pitta-doṣa*), once perceived milk to be bitter. After being cured, they remember that experience. Do they, in remembering it, re-experience the bitter taste? No. Instead, they think, "Ah, in the past, that bitterness was caused by my illness." Similarly, for liberated souls, their omniscience itself becomes the medicine that cures them of all forms of suffering. Therefore, there is never any possibility of sorrow for them.

In truth, all of these intricate arguments are merely webs of speculation spun from the intellect (*kevalabuddhikṛtakalpanājālamātram*), arising from our present lack of direct experience of the state of liberation. They are presented here for the sake of those with simple minds, in keeping with the principle, "One should not create confusion in the minds of the ignorant." True seekers who desire what is best for themselves should stay far away from such fruitless inquiries—like examining the teeth of a crow (*kākadantaparīkṣā*)—especially those with tender intellects. The steadfast should simply focus on their spiritual practices, meditating on all that is auspicious. These intricate arguments are offered for the sake of those who have already been misled by rationalist debates, not for true devotees.
