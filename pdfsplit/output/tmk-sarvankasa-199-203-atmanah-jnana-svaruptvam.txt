### Exposition of the Argument

An objection is raised regarding the nature of the self. The Praśna Upaniṣad (4.9) states, "Truly, this is the seer, the creator, the hearer, the smeller, the taster, the thinker, the understander, the agent—the person whose nature is consciousness (*vijñānātmā puruṣaḥ*)." Based on this, the objector argues that scripture describes the self (*jīva*) as being of the very nature of consciousness. Therefore, the claim that the self is a knower (*jñātṛtva*)—that is, a *substrate* for knowledge—appears to contradict scripture.

The verse beginning *jñānatvam* is intended to resolve this objection.

**Verse 75:** *Scripture here states the self's nature is knowledge (*jñānatva*), not that mere consciousness is the self. The latter would conflict with direct perception and other proofs. When a commonality is stated, knowledge is the illumination of an object.*

The commentary explains: In this matter, the scripture ("Truly, this is the seer...") states that the self (*puṃsaḥ*) has the nature of knowledge (*jñānatvam*); it does not, however, state that mere consciousness (*buddhimātrasya*)—that which is not a substrate for knowledge—is the self (*puṃstvam*). The reason for this distinction is that identifying the self with mere consciousness would lead to a direct conflict (*prakopāt*) with all valid means of knowledge (*pramāṇa*), beginning with direct perception (*pratyakṣa*), scripture, and authoritative texts.

The point is this: in worldly experience, we encounter the irrefutable awareness, "I know" (*ahaṃ jānāmi*) or "I am one who possesses knowledge" (*jñānavānaham*). This establishes the self as a substrate of knowledge, a conclusion that is unavoidable. The experience "I know" is never negated by an experience like "I do not know" for anyone at any time.

At this point, another objection is raised: what about the scriptural passage from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (4.4.14), "By what means could one know that by which all this is known?" Does this not prohibit the self from being an object of knowledge (*jñeyatva*)? And if so, how can the worldly experience "I know" be valid, since it presents the self as an object of knowledge? In a conflict between scripture and direct perception, scripture is the stronger authority; therefore, should we not conclude that the self's status as a substrate of knowledge is illusory?

No. That scriptural passage does not deny that the self can be an object of knowledge. Rather, it denies that the self's existence is established by *another* cognition (*jñānāntarādhīnasiddhikatvameva niṣidhyate*). The text establishes the self's self-luminosity (*svaprakāśatvam*). While inert objects like pots (*ghaṭa*) are established only through an act of knowing because they are non-conscious (*jaḍatvāt*), the self is not established in this way because it is self-established (*svatassiddhatvāt*). To claim otherwise would render the scriptural passage meaningless.

If you then ask how something that is self-luminous can be an object of another cognition, we reply that there is no contradiction between being self-luminous (*svayaṃprakāśatva*) and being knowable (*vedyatva*), a point that will be established in detail later. Furthermore, if the self were not an object of knowledge at all, it could not be considered an object of proof (*prameyatvam*). And if it were not an object of proof, it would have to be considered unreal (*mithyātva*). Besides, being an object of proof is a universally applicable property (*kevalānvayi*); how could it fail to apply to the self?

Returning to the scripture originally cited (Praśna 4.9) to prove that the self *is* knowledge, we see that it does not actually deny that the self is a *substrate* of knowledge. The verse begins, "Truly, this is the seer..." (*eṣa hi draṣṭā*), thereby restating the commonly known and perceived nature of the self before declaring that its essential nature is consciousness. It does not negate this common perception.

But, one might argue, the main purpose (*tātparya*) of a scriptural text is not to repeat what is already known. That is true; there is no need to prove something already established. However, this does not mean that what is already established is thereby negated. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the self is both of the nature of knowledge (*jñānasvarūpaḥ*) and the substrate of knowledge (*jñānāśrayaḥ*). This harmonizes both worldly experience and scripture.

Yet another objection arises: how can something that *is* knowledge also serve as the substrate *for* knowledge? We do not observe two things of the same nature in a substrate-attribute relationship. Color, for example, does not inhere in another color, but in a substance. To resolve this, the verse continues: *anugatakathane...* When we need to state the common characteristic (*anugatam rūpam*) shared by both the substrate (the self) and its attribute (its knowledge)—a commonality that follows from both being self-luminous—that common characteristic is that knowledge is the illumination of an object (*jñānam arthaprakāśaḥ*).

**Verse 5:** *The self (*ātmā*) experiences its own existence by itself. Consciousness (*mati*), however, experiences the existence of both itself and other things. Statements identifying the self as 'mere knowledge' are intended only to refute the possibility of its being non-conscious (*jāḍya*).*

This shared nature as "illumination" is what allows both the self and its knowledge to be designated by the term "knowledge," and it is explained as follows: The self (*ātmā*) experiences its own existence (*siddhi*) by and for itself; its existence is not directed toward some other object. In contrast, its consciousness (*mati*), which is its essential attribute (*dharmabhūta jñāna*), experiences the existence or manifestation (*siddhibhāvam*) of both itself *and* other external objects (*svānyayoḥ*). This is why both can properly be referred to by the word "knowledge" (*jñāna*).

The initial objection—that two things of the same nature cannot have a substrate-attribute relationship—is resolved because the self and its attributive knowledge are not identical in all respects. The self (*ātmā*) is inward-facing (*pratyak*), whereas its knowledge is outward-facing (*parāk*). Their commonality lies in their nature as illumination (*prakāśarūpatā*). To argue that *any* shared property, such as being self-luminous, rules out a substrate-attribute relationship would be an error. After all, all entities share the property of being provable (*prameyatva*), yet this does not prevent us from recognizing the relationship between a substance and its quality. And as just noted, a crucial difference between the self and its knowledge has already been stated.

In fact, the self (*ātmā*) is not a verbal root's meaning (*dhātvartha*), because it is an established entity (*siddharūpa*), whereas verbal roots signify actions (*kriyā*), which are always things to be accomplished (*sādhyarūpā*). For this reason, the word "knowledge" (*jñāna*), derived from the root *jñā* (to know), properly refers to attributive knowledge (*dharmabhūta jñāna*), not to the self (*ātmā*). The correct term for the self is "I" (*aham*). This is why the self is defined as the referent of "I."

This point is made explicit in the Upaniṣads. For instance, the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad states, "In the beginning, this was the Self (*ātman*) alone, in the form of a person... He looked around and saw nothing other than himself. He first said, 'I am' (*so'hamasmi*). Therefore, he came to be named 'I' (*ahaṃnāma*)" (1.4.1), and again, "Its secret name is 'I'" (5.5.4). These passages explicitly state that the primary word for the self is "I."

(The commentary then briefly addresses and dismisses an objection that these passages refer only to Hiraṇyagarbha, the cosmic person, not the individual self, by stating that Hiraṇyagarbha is the collective self and that the term *ātman* is used at the outset of the passage.)

The word "I" (*aham*) clearly indicates the inward-facing (*pratyaktvam*) and therefore self-luminous (*svaprakāśatvam*) nature of its referent. It is only because the word "knowledge" (*jñāna*) also refers to a self-luminous entity (i.e., attributive consciousness) that the self is metaphorically described as "of the nature of knowledge" (*ātmā jñānasvarūpaḥ*). One should not be confused by this into thinking that the word "knowledge" applies equally to both the substance (the self) and its attribute (consciousness). Therefore, the objection that things of the same nature cannot be in a substrate-attribute relationship has no basis.

(The commentary further clarifies the distinction between inward-facing (*pratyak*) and outward-facing (*parāk*) self-luminous entities, and reiterates that a substance-attribute relationship between two self-luminous entities, like the self and its knowledge, is perfectly coherent.)

As for the initial scriptural citation ("Truly, this is the seer..."), one should not mistakenly think that seeing, hearing, etc., are being prescribed. The particle "truly" (*hi*) indicates a well-known fact. The passage simply restates the commonly known status of the self as a seer and knower in order to teach its true nature as consciousness. It does not legislate that the self is a seer. Nor should one argue that, based on the principle that scripture is only meaningful when it teaches something not otherwise known (*aprāpte śāstramarthavat*), the scripture must be *negating* the common understanding of the self as a seer. Restating a known fact (*anuvāda*) is not the same as negating it. Scripture is not the primary proof for the self's being a knower; worldly experience is. Simply stating that scripture is not the authority for this fact does not amount to a denial of the fact itself.

Now, what about passages like "a mass of consciousness" (*vijñānaghana eva*) from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (4.5.13)? Doesn't the emphatic particle "alone" (*eva*) negate anything other than consciousness, including the self's status as a knower?

The verse answers this: **Statements identifying the self as 'mere knowledge' are intended only to refute the possibility of its being non-conscious (*jāḍya*).** That is, texts that seem to describe the self as consisting of nothing but knowledge should be understood as teaching that the self, as a knower, has no part or aspect—such as its essential properties of eternality, unity, and inwardness—that is non-luminous or inert (*jaḍa*).

The scripture compares the self to a lump of salt: "Just as a lump of salt thrown in water would dissolve into the water, and one would not be able to grasp it, but wherever one tastes, it is salty, so indeed, this great, endless, infinite being is a mass of consciousness alone (*vijñānaghana eva*)..." Just as a lump of salt is salty through and through, with no part that is not salty, so too the self is conscious through and through, with no part that is non-conscious (*avijñānarūpatā*). The term "mass of consciousness" (*prajñānaghanaḥ* or *vijñānaghanaḥ*) is used in this sense. It does not negate the self's status as the *substrate* of that consciousness. When a defining quality is used with an emphatic particle, it only excludes its opposite. Describing the salt lump as "entirely a mass of taste" does not negate its other properties, like its color or form. Similarly, describing the self as a "mass of consciousness" negates non-consciousness, not its status as a knower.

The terms used alongside this description, "without interior" (*anantaraḥ*) and "without exterior" (*abāhyaḥ*), confirm this. The interior of a thing is its essential nature (*svarūpa*), and its exterior refers to its attributes (*dharma*). The passage thus implies that both the self's nature and its attributes are non-inert (*ajaḍa*). This establishes that the essential attributes of the self, such as its inwardness (*pratyaktva*), are also self-luminous. If a non-inert self had inert attributes, the "I" (*ahamartha*) would be a composite of the conscious and the non-conscious, which has been refuted.

(The commentary then engages in a technical discussion, refuting the idea that the self could be a bare, property-less substance, and addresses a potential objection: if the self's attributes are also self-luminous, why are they not all manifest to the bound soul, which would erase the distinction between bondage and liberation? The reply is that the manifestation of these properties is obscured by karma, just as the sweetness of milk is not perceived by someone with a bitter taste in their mouth. The degree to which the self and its properties are manifest is what distinguishes the states of bondage and liberation.)

Finally, the analogy of the lamp (*dīpa*) can be used to establish how something can be of the nature of knowledge (light) and also a substrate of knowledge (a lighter of things). A lamp is both luminous in itself and emits light that illuminates other objects. Thus, the self is not mere consciousness but is also the substrate of consciousness.

(The commentary concludes with a complex and nuanced discussion on the "atomic size" (*aṇutva*) of the self, arguing that describing it as a "mass" (*ghana*) is a conceptual model (*kalpanā*) because its true, non-physical dimensions are beyond our ordinary intellect, which is accustomed to the properties of physical matter. This conceptualization is necessary because its true form is difficult to grasp, especially in its state of bondage where its attributive knowledge is contracted.)
