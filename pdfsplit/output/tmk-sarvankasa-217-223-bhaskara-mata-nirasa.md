### Exposition of the Argument on the Plurality of Individual Selves

**Introduction: Setting the Stage for the Inquiry**

After establishing that the individual self (*jīva*) is distinct from the body, senses, mind, life-breath (*prāṇa*), and intellect (*buddhi*); that it is self-luminous (*svaprakāśa*) and intrinsically an "inner" subject (*pratyaktva*); and that its capacity for agency (*kartṛtva*) is natural (*svābhāvika*) to it, the commentary now turns to two further essential topics concerning the nature of the self. These are the plurality of individual selves (*jīvanānātva*) and their fundamental distinction from the Supreme Being, Brahman (*brahmavailakṣaṇya*).

To begin this detailed investigation, the commentator first addresses and refutes the position of Bhāskara, who argues that the distinction between selves is merely adventitious.

**Bhāskara’s View: The Doctrine of Adventitious Difference**

Bhāskara’s position is that the apparent difference among individual selves (*jīvas*) and between the self and the Supreme Self (*paramātman*) is not intrinsic but is caused by limiting adjuncts (*upādhi*). The argument runs by analogy: just as the one, undivided great space (*mahākāśa*) is spoken of as distinct entities like "pot-space" (*ghaṭākāśa*) or "house-space" (*gṛhākāśa*) due to its association with limiting objects like pots and houses, so too the one Supreme Self appears as many distinct selves. In this view, the limiting adjunct is a real form of ignorance (*avidyā*).

When the limiting adjunct is destroyed—when the pot is broken—the "pot-space" becomes one with the great space. Similarly, when the self’s limiting adjuncts are removed, the individual self merges into absolute unity with the Supreme Self. This attainment of oneness is liberation (*mokṣa*). Therefore, according to Bhāskara, the difference (*bheda*) between the self and Brahman is merely adventitious (*aupādhika*), while their non-difference or identity (*abheda*) is what is natural (*svābhāvika*). The perceived differences *among* individual selves are also explained by the multiplicity of these real limiting adjuncts.

Before refuting this, the commentator briefly surveys the landscape of other philosophical schools to provide historical context for the crisis this argument addresses. These include the materialist Cārvākas who deny any self beyond the body; the Mādhyamika Buddhists who advocate for a doctrine of no-self (*nairātmyavāda*); other Buddhist schools that define the self as merely a stream of momentary consciousness (*kṣaṇikavijñāna*); and the Illusionist Vedāntins (*brahmavivartavādinaḥ*) who, while accepting Brahman, deny the reality of individual selves as separate entities. It is within this complex field of debate that the present analysis takes place.

#### **Verse 10: The Argument for the Intrinsic Plurality of Selves**

> Individual selves (*jīvas*) must be intrinsically distinct, due to the strictly regulated nature of their respective cognitions, memories, desires, and experiences of pleasure. This regulation cannot be explained by the mere difference of inner faculties, just as it cannot be explained by the difference of bodies or external senses. Scripture declares that selves are eternal and distinct, and this plurality cannot be merely due to limiting adjuncts. As for the scriptures teaching the non-duality of the Self, their true import is different, a fact established within their own respective contexts.

**Part 1: The Argument from Experience**

The first line of the verse presents the core thesis: individual selves (*jīvas*) are distinct from one another by their very nature (*svataḥ bhinnāḥ*), not because of some external condition.

The proof for this comes from direct experience: there is a strictly regulated and mutually exclusive distribution (*pratiniyatatayā*) of mental events like cognition (*dhī*), memory (*smṛti*), desire (*icchā*), pleasure (*sukha*), and pain (*duḥkha*). One person’s happiness is not experienced by another; one person’s memory is not accessible to someone else. This universally observed "system" (*vyavasthā*) of private experience requires a plurality of distinct experiencers. This position is not unique to our school; other systems of thought affirm it. The Vaiśeṣika Sūtras state, "Souls are many, due to the regulation [of experience]," and the Sāṃkhya tradition argues, "The multiplicity of persons (*puruṣa*) is established from the distinct regulation of birth, death, and faculties... and from the varied distribution of the three cosmic qualities (*traiguṇa*)."

An opponent might object, arguing that this regulation of experience is not due to a plurality of selves, but to a plurality of *inner faculties* (*antaḥkaraṇa* or *cetas*). Perhaps there is only one self operating through many different minds.

The verse refutes this objection decisively. The regulation of experience cannot be established merely by the difference of inner faculties (*cetobhedāt*), just as it cannot be established by the difference of bodies or external senses (*dehabāhyākṣabhedāt*). To illustrate this, consider a single self that takes on multiple bodies in different births; the difference in bodies does not imply a difference in the self. Even more pointedly, the sage Saubhari is described as having assumed many bodies at the same time. Despite the multiplicity of his bodies, senses, and inner faculties, he retained a unified consciousness, recognizing himself with the thought "I am that same person" (*so'ham*). If the self were one, but the inner faculties many, we would expect a unified consciousness to have access to all the experiences occurring through those faculties. Since we do not observe such a state of affairs—where one person experiences another’s thoughts or pains—we must conclude that the mere difference of instruments (minds) does not account for the strict regulation of experience. The agents themselves must be distinct.

Furthermore, a deeper logical problem arises for the opponent. The inner faculty (*antaḥkaraṇa*) is an *instrument* (*karaṇa*) for perception, analogous to the eye for seeing form. Any instrument requires an agent (*kartṛ*) to wield it. This means the existence of distinct agents (selves) who have distinct experiences is the basis for inferring that they must possess distinct instruments (minds). To argue the reverse—that the difference in instruments creates the appearance of different agents—is to fall into the fallacy of mutual dependence (*anyonyāśraya*). The distinction of selves must be primary.

**Part 2: The Argument from Scripture**

The commentary now turns to scriptural authority (*nigama*). The Vedas themselves declare that individual selves are both eternal (*nityān*) and distinct from one another (*bhinnān*). A key passage is cited from the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad (6.13): "The one eternal Consciousness among the many eternal conscious beings, who fulfills the desires of the many..." This text explicitly posits a plurality of eternal, conscious beings—the *jīvas*—and one supreme eternal Conscious Being who provides for them. The text clearly affirms the oneness of God and the manyness of the selves.

The opponent might concede the text but argue that this plurality (*anekatva*) is merely adventitious (*aupādhika*), not ultimate.

The verse counters: this plurality cannot be due to limiting adjuncts (*tat hi na upādhitaḥ syāt*). In a context of fundamental teaching (*vidhi*), where new and definitive truth is being conveyed, one cannot resort to secondary or figurative meanings (*amukhya arthaḥ*). If we assume that scriptures intended to reveal ultimate reality are not speaking literally, then no truth could ever be firmly established from them. In this case, where the very purpose of the text is to teach the truth about God and the self, resorting to a non-literal interpretation would make it impossible to ascertain any definite reality at all.

Moreover, this scriptural passage links the knowledge it imparts to the attainment of "eternal happiness" (*teṣāṃ sukhaṃ śāśvatam*). How could knowledge of something that is merely adventitious and thus not ultimately real—the plurality of selves in the opponent’s view—be the cause of the ultimate, eternal goal? According to the opponent’s own system, it is the knowledge of the *falsity* of such adventitious distinctions that should lead to liberation, not the knowledge of them as described. Therefore, the plurality taught in this passage must be natural and real.

But what of the scriptural passages that teach non-duality (*ātmādvaita-śrutī*), such as "This Self is Brahman" (*ayamātmā brahma*) and "You are That" (*tattvamasi*)?

The verse provides the hermeneutic key: the intended meaning of these scriptures is different (*itarahṛdayatā*), and this is established by examining their surrounding context (*tatra tatraiva siddhā*). Their use of grammatical co-reference (*sāmānādhikaraṇya*) to equate the self and Brahman does not signify absolute numerical identity. Rather, depending on the context, it signifies either the inseparable relationship between body and soul (*śarīra-śarīri-bhāva*)—where the universe is the body of Brahman—or the relationship between an effect and its material cause (*upādāna-upodeya-bhāva*). In this interpretive framework, all scriptural statements can be harmonized without dismissing any as less true than others. The difference between selves is thus established as an intrinsic reality, supported by both experience and scripture.

#### **Verse 11: Refutation of Co-existing Natural Difference and Non-Difference**

> The view that individual selves (*jīvas*) are, like atoms in the physical elements, intrinsically distinct parts of Brahman (which is pure Being), and that this natural distinction securely establishes the regulation [of experience] in the world, is incorrect. For if their oneness [with Brahman] is also held to be unbreakable, then infinite flaws would necessarily accrue to the flawless Brahman. Therefore, this position, even while affirming the reality [of the world], has been deemed by the wise to be even more flawed than the doctrine of illusion.

**Yādava Prakāśa’s View: The Doctrine of Natural Difference-and-Non-Difference**

Having refuted Bhāskara, the commentator now turns to the view of Yādava Prakāśa, who proposed that difference (*bheda*) and non-difference (*abheda*) are *both* natural (*svābhāvika*) and co-exist.

According to Yādava, Brahman, which is pure Being (*sanmātra-brahman*), has real parts. The individual selves (*jīvas*) are these parts. Just as the physical elements (*pṛthvyādibhūta*) are constituted by innumerable, distinct atoms (*aṇu*), the selves are intrinsically distinct from each other (*svataḥ bhedavantaḥ*) as parts of Brahman. Because this difference is natural to them, the regulated systems (*niyatayaḥ*) of pleasure, pain, and karma are perfectly well-established (*susthitāḥ*) and do not get mixed up. In his model, Brahman possesses three powers that evolve into three distinct portions: the unconscious material world (*acit*), the conscious selves (*cit*), and the controller, God (*īśvara*). All merits and demerits are confined to their respective portions, preventing any contamination of Brahman itself.

**The Refutation**

The verse declares this view to be "incorrect" (*ayuktam*). The central reason for its rejection lies in the fatal consequences of asserting that *both* difference and non-difference are equally real and natural.

The core of the refutation is this: because the non-difference, or oneness (*aikya*), of the self with Brahman is held to be equally real and unbreakable (*akṣatatvāt*), any flaw inherent in a part must also affect the whole. Individual selves are subject to ignorance, suffering, and limitation. If these selves are simultaneously and naturally non-different from Brahman, then Brahman itself—which scripture defines as flawless, perfect, and pure Being (*sati brahmaṇi*)—must also be subject to these flaws. This would lead to the unacceptable conclusion that Brahman is afflicted with infinite imperfections (*anavadhi avadyam*). A theory that compromises the perfection of the Absolute cannot be correct.

The verse concludes with a powerful final verdict. This position, despite its merit of accepting the world as real (*satyaṃ tat ca*), is considered by the wise (*abhijñaiḥ*) to be even worse than the doctrine of illusion (*mṛṣāvāda-ataḥ api eṣa pakṣaḥ bahiragaṇi*). While the illusionist view of Advaita Vedānta is problematic for denying the reality of the world we experience, Yādava Prakāśa’s view is philosophically more ruinous because it directly introduces imperfection and suffering into the very nature of Brahman. By trying to hold two contradictory truths—natural difference and natural non-difference—as equally ultimate, it destroys the flawless nature of the ultimate reality itself.
