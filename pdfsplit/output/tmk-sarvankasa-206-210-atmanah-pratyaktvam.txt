### An Exposition on the Nature of the Self as the Referent of "I"

This passage presents a detailed defense of the thesis that the individual self (*ātman*) is the true and direct referent of the word and concept "I" (*aham*). It systematically dismantles the opposing view that the "I" is a composite entity, a mixture of the pure, conscious self and the non-conscious internal organ (*antaḥkaraṇa*). The argument unfolds by first defining selfhood (*pratyaktva*), refining this definition against objections, and culminating in scriptural evidence.

#### The Definition of Selfhood (Pratyaktva)

The discussion begins by examining the nature of selfhood (*pratyaktva*). Some philosophers—namely, those who deny the self-luminous nature of the self, such as the Vaiśeṣikas—propose a minimalist definition. They argue that selfhood is **merely being the substrate of a cognition that has oneself as its object** (*svaviṣayadhiṣaṇādhāratā-mātram*). In this view, for me to be a self is simply for the thought "I know myself" to occur *in* me.

The commentator immediately rejects this as inadequate. He argues that since the self-s-evidence (*svataḥsiddhi*) of the self has already been established in a prior argument, a more fitting definition is required. Selfhood is not just being the passive subject of self-cognition; it is the active state of **manifesting to itself, by itself** (*svasmai svenaiva bhānam*). This inherent self-luminosity is a foundational concept.

Before proceeding, the commentator pauses to address a methodological objection. An opponent might ask: “How can you claim to prove something about the self through inference (*anumāna*) if the self is not an object of knowledge in the conventional sense? This seems as paradoxical as promising a conversation with a barren woman’s son.”

The reply is direct: this use of inference is purely for the sake of refuting an opponent who does not accept the self’s self-luminosity. Even the great scholar Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, for instance, argued for an insentient self (*jaḍātmavādī*). It is to convince such thinkers that inferential arguments are presented. This does not contradict the core doctrine, which holds that the self does not *depend* on another cognition for its existence to be established (*jñānāntarādhīnasiddhikatva*). To be clear, the self can certainly be an object of knowledge—for instance, it is the object of the cognition generated by the word “self” (*ātmapada*), otherwise the word would be meaningless. The crucial point is that its *validation* or existential certainty (*siddhi*) is not dependent on another source; it is self-validating (*svayaṃsiddha*).

Another objection is raised: “If the self is inherently blissful and self-luminous, why would anyone in this world experience suffering?” The answer lies in the doctrine of karma. In the state of worldly existence (*saṃsāra*), the inherent bliss of the self’s nature is veiled by one’s karma. Because this innate felicity does not shine forth completely, worldly souls (*saṃsārin*) pursue happiness through external objects. They operate under the delusion that pleasure derived from objects is true happiness, and this delusion effectively eclipses the awareness of the self’s intrinsic bliss during the waking state. In deep sleep (*suṣupti*), however, when the awareness of external objects and their pleasures ceases, the happiness that is the self’s own nature shines forth. This is why, upon waking, a person reports, "I slept happily." This experience is not, as some argue, merely an inference based on the absence of burdens (like saying "I feel happy" after putting down a heavy load). That explanation would only be necessary if the self were insentient (*jaḍa*). For a self that is self-luminous (*svaprakāśatva*), it is its own nature that shines forth in deep sleep.

#### The Core Problem: Is the "I" a Pure Self or a Mixture?

Having established the self-luminous nature of the self, the commentator turns to the central challenge. The opponent argues that the self cannot be simply and purely the referent of "I" (*aham*). Their reasoning is as follows:

1.  The experience of "I" seems to include a non-sentient component, the internal organ (*antaḥkaraṇa*).
2.  The very same entity that I refer to as "I" (*aham*) is referred to by others as "you" (*tvam*), "this person" (*ayam*), or "that person" (*saḥ*).
3.  "I-ness" (*ahaṃtva*) is a form of selfhood (*pratyaktva*), while "you-ness" (*tvaṃtva*) and "that-ness" are forms of otherness (*parāktva*).
4.  Since the same entity can be designated as both a "self" and an "other," it must be a mixture (*miśrita*) of two principles: a self-component (*pratyagaṃśa*), which is the true soul (*ātman*), and an other-component (*parāgaṃśa*), which is the non-sentient internal organ.
5.  Therefore, the referent of "I" (*ahamartha*) is not the pure self, but consciousness as conditioned by the internal organ (*antaḥkaraṇāvacchinnaṃ caitanyam*).

This sets the stage for the commentator’s primary argument, which is a meticulous dissection and redefinition of the concepts of "self" (*pratyak*) and "other" (*parāk*).

#### Redefining "Self" and "Other"

The commentator argues that this entire problem is based on a misunderstanding. An entity is a **self (*pratyaṅ*) only from its own perspective** (*svāpekṣayā*). From the perspective of everyone else (*svetaraiḥ*), that very same self is perceived and designated as an "other"—as "you" (*tvam*) or "this person" (*ayam*). The fact that one being is the referent of "I" for itself and "you" for another does not imply it is a mixture of sentience and insentience. Selfhood is relational to the subject.

This leads to a critical distinction. The opponent wrongly equates otherness (*parāktva*) with insentience (*jaḍatva*). The commentator insists they are not the same. Something can be an "other" without being insentient. To be an "other" (*parāk*) simply means to be an object for another's consciousness. For example, my attributive consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*), while self-luminous and not insentient, exists for my sake, to illuminate objects for me. I am the ultimate enjoyer of its illumination (*phalabhoktā*). Therefore, I am the self (*pratyak*), while my consciousness, which serves me, is an "other" (*parāk*) relative to me. Since otherness does not equal insentience, the fact that the self appears as an "other" to another person does not mean it becomes insentient.

An opponent might bring up the famous verse: "To an ascetic, a lover, and a dog, the body of a beautiful woman is, respectively, a corpse, an object of desire, and food." This shows that properties can be perspective-dependent. The commentator briefly acknowledges this but sets it aside as a topic handled elsewhere, refusing to be sidetracked.

He then offers a more precise definition to resolve the issue. The error lies in a vague definition of insentience (*jaḍatva*).
*   **Otherness (*parāktva*)** is merely **appearing to another** (*parasmai bhāsamānatvam*).
*   **Insentience (*jaḍatva*)** is **appearing *only* to another** (*parasmā eva bhāsamānatvam*).

A pot is insentient because it appears only to a conscious observer; it never appears to itself. The self (*ātman*), however, is different. While it appears to others (and is thus an "other" from their perspective), it also fundamentally **appears to itself** (*svasmai bhāsate*). Because its manifestation is not *only* for another, it is not insentient. Therefore, the referent of "I" (*ahamartha*) involves a combination of selfhood (from its own perspective) and otherness (from another's perspective), but this does not entail a mixture of sentience and insentience (*jaḍatva-ajaḍatvayoḥ*). The "I" is not a hybrid of consciousness and matter.

The commentator further clarifies this by addressing the objection, "When someone says 'I am fat' (*ahaṃ sthūlaḥ*), surely the 'I' refers to the body." His response is sharp: this is the confused discourse of worldly people (*saṃsāriṇām*), not the enlightened. It is a classic case of conflating word, meaning, and cognition (*śabdārthapratyayānāṃ sāṅkaryam*). When one person says "I," referring to their self, another person addresses them as "you," but the "you" they perceive is the body, because the pure self is beyond the senses (*atīndriya*). The referent of the "I" (the inner self) and the referent of the "you" (the outer body) are simply different things. There is no mixing.

#### Refutation of the Anātman View of "I"

The commentator now directly confronts the opposing school (identified with Advaita Vedānta, though argued to be influenced by Buddhist and Sāṃkhya thought) that claims the "self is not the referent of 'I'" (*ātmā na-ahamarthaḥ*). He quotes the Śrībhāṣya, which calls this position as self-contradictory as the statement "my mother is barren."

He then presses the opponent with a trilemma: What exactly do you mean?
1.  **Do you mean the self does not appear as an object in the cognition of "I"?** This is false, as even your own teachers (a reference to Śaṅkara) admit the self is the object of the "I"-cognition (*ahaṃpratyayaviṣayatvāt*).
2.  **Do you mean the self is not inherently a "self" (*pratyak*)?** This is impossible, as selfhood is the self's very nature (*svarūpa*).
3.  **Do you mean the self is not denoted by the word "I"?** This is contradicted by universal linguistic practice, as everyone uses "I" to refer to themselves and nothing else.

An opponent might try to salvage their position by quoting their teacher more carefully: "It is not that the self is *entirely* a non-object, because it is the object of the 'I'-cognition." They would argue this implies the self is only *partially* an object. The commentator dismisses this as quoting out of context. The full passage shows the teacher was refuting the claim that the self is a total non-object. Furthermore, this logic is flawed. When you see a pot, you do not perceive every single one of its attributes. Does this mean the pot is only partially an object of perception? If so, the pot becomes as unknowable as Brahman, which is absurd.

The argument culminates in a powerful analogy. The opponent claims that the pure self lends its consciousness to the insentient internal organ (*antaḥkaraṇa*), making the internal organ appear as "I." Yet, they deny that the self itself is the "I." The commentator finds this ridiculous: "This is as laughable as saying that fire itself does not burn, even while asserting that it is the infusion of fire into a piece of iron that makes the iron capable of burning (*ayo dahati*)." The very selfhood (*pratyaktva*) that the self imparts is its own nature as "I." Therefore, even in states like deep sleep where the word "I" is not used, the self's nature as the referent of "I" remains undiminished.

#### The Ultimate Proof from Scripture

Finally, the commentator provides the definitive evidence from the *Bhūmavidyā* section of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. There, the sage Sanatkumāra instructs on the knowledge of the self that overcomes all sorrow.
1.  He begins by describing the ultimate reality, Bhūman (the Vast), which is the Self of all: "**He** alone is below... **He** is all this."
2.  Crucially, he then identifies this universal Self with the "I": "And now, the instruction concerning the **I** (*ahaṅkārādeśa*)... **I** alone am below... **I** am all this."
3.  He concludes the entire teaching by explicitly equating it with the self: "And now, the instruction concerning the **Self** (*ātmādeśa*)... The **Self** alone is below... The **Self** is all this."

The commentator argues that this deliberate sequence, where "He," "I," and "Self" are used interchangeably to refer to the same ultimate reality, decisively proves that the referent of "I" (*ahamartha*) is the true, ultimate Self. Liberation (*mokṣa*) is therefore not the annihilation of the "I"-referent, but its infinite expansion (*ahamarthavaipulyam*). This is the final and paramount conclusion of the doctrine.
