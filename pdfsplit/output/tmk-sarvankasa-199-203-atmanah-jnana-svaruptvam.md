Here is an exposition of the philosophical argument presented in the commentary.

### The Nature of the Self: Knower or Mere Knowledge?

This section of the commentary addresses a foundational question in Vedānta philosophy: Is the individual self (*ātman*) identical to pure consciousness, or is it a conscious entity that knows, a "knower" (*jñātṛ*)? The argument begins by interpreting a key scriptural passage to establish the self as both possessing the nature of knowledge and being an active knower.

**Verse 75:** **The scripture here declares that the self (*puṃs*) has the nature of knowledge (*jñānatva*), not that mere knowledge (*buddhimātra*) is the self. To claim otherwise would conflict with direct perception and other valid sources of knowledge. When a common basis for both the self and its knowledge is sought, it is found in this: knowledge is the illumination of an object (*arthaprakāśaḥ*).**

The commentary unpacks this dense verse by first addressing a potential objection. An opponent might cite the *Praśna Upaniṣad* (4.9), which states: “Truly, this is the seer, toucher, hearer, smeller, taster, thinker, ascertainer, doer—the self which is of the nature of consciousness (*vijñānātmā*), the person.” The opponent argues that the final description, *vijñānātmā*, implies the self is *nothing but* consciousness, rendering the preceding descriptions of it as a "seer," "hearer," and "doer" merely figurative. This would mean the self is not a true knower, and its status as a knower is contrary to scripture.

The commentator refutes this interpretation with the following argument:

1.  **Scripture Affirms, It Does Not Negate:** The scripture in question (*śruti*) declares that the self (*puṃs*) *has the nature of knowledge* (*jñānatvam*); it does not state that mere consciousness, which is not the substrate of knowing, constitutes the self (*puṃstva*). The passage first lists the universally recognized functions of a knower (seeing, hearing, etc.) and then adds the information that this very knower is, by its intrinsic nature, consciousness. It affirms both aspects, rather than using one to negate the other. To argue otherwise would create a conflict (*prakopa*) with all other means of knowledge (*pramāṇa*), including direct perception.

2.  **The Evidence of Uncontradicted Experience:** In the world, the experience "I know" (*ahaṃ jānāmi*) or "I am one who has knowledge" (*jñānavān aham*) is a direct, undeniable, and universally accepted perception. This experience clearly establishes the self as a substrate of knowledge (*jñānāśrayatvam*). This cognition is never contradicted by a subsequent experience like "I do not know" in a way that negates the "I" as the subject.

3.  **Reinterpreting a Potential Scriptural Objection:** An objector might counter with another famous passage from the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad* (4.4.14): “That by which all this is known, by what means can one know the knower (*taṃ kena vijānīyāt*)?” This seems to explicitly deny that the self can be an object of knowledge (*jñeyatva*), which would contradict the experience "I know" (where the "I" is the object of its own cognition). In a conflict between scripture and perception, scripture is held to be stronger. Therefore, the feeling of being a knower must be an illusion (*mithyā*).

    The commentary responds that this is a misreading. The passage does not deny that the self can be an object of knowledge altogether. Instead, it denies that the self's existence depends on being illumined by *another* act of knowledge, in the way a physical object like a pot does. A pot is inert (*jaḍa*) and requires an external consciousness to be known. The self, however, is self-established (*svataḥsiddha*). The purpose of this scriptural statement is to teach the self's self-luminosity (*svaprakāśatva*). If it meant the self was absolutely unknowable, the statement itself would be meaningless.

4.  **The Logical Consequences of Unknowability:** Furthermore, if the self were not an object of knowledge (*jñeya*), it could not be an object of proof (*prameya*) either. To be without the status of a provable entity (*prameyatvābhāva*) is tantamount to being unreal (*mithyā*). Moreover, being an object of proof (*prameyatva*) is a universally affirmative attribute (*kevalānvayi*); it applies to everything that exists. How could the self be excluded from it? Therefore, the self must be knowable. The apparent conflict between being self-luminous and being an object of knowledge will be resolved later in the text by showing they are not mutually exclusive.

The conclusion is a harmonization (*samanvaya*) of experience and scripture: the self is both luminous by nature (*jñānasvarūpa*) and the substrate of knowledge (*jñānāśraya*).

### The Substrate-Attribute Relationship of Consciousness

A new objection arises: How can something that *is* knowledge also be the *substrate* of knowledge? This seems to violate the principle that a quality cannot reside in another thing of the same nature; for example, color does not reside in color, but in a substance (*dravya*) like a pot.

The commentary addresses this by distinguishing two forms of consciousness, as indicated in the second half of Verse 75 and elaborated in Verse 5 of the *Jīvasara*:

**Verse 5 (*Jīvasara*): The self (*ātmā*) experiences its own existence (*siddhi*) for itself alone. Consciousness (*mati*), however, experiences the existence of both itself and other things. Statements describing the self as 'mere knowledge' (*jñānamātra*) are intended to refute any possibility of its being inert (*jāḍya*).**

1.  **A Distinction in Function:** The self and its knowledge are not identical in all respects. The common characteristic that allows both to be called "knowledge" (*jñāna*) is their nature as "the illumination of an object" (*arthaprakāśaḥ*). However, they differ in their scope and orientation:
    *   The **self** (*ātmā*), as the substrate consciousness (*dharmi-jñāna*), is inherently self-aware. It illuminates itself *for itself* (*svasyaiva siddhiṃ anubhavati*). It is inward-facing (*pratyak*).
    *   The **attributive knowledge** (*dharmabhūta jñāna* or *mati*), on the other hand, illuminates both itself *and* external objects (*svānyayoḥ siddhibhāvam*). It is outward-facing (*parāk*).

2.  **Compatibility of Substrate and Attribute:** This functional distinction is sufficient to resolve the objection. The self and its knowledge are not identical in every way. The fact that they share a common nature as "luminous" (*prakāśa*) does not prevent one from being the substrate for the other, just as the fact that all things share the property of "being provable" (*prameyatva*) does not prevent a substance-attribute relationship between them. Since there is a significant difference (*vaiṣamya*) in their function, the substrate-attribute relationship (*āśrayāśrayibhāva*) is perfectly coherent.

### Interpreting "A Mass of Consciousness"

The opponent raises another powerful scriptural objection, citing the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad* (4.4.12), which describes the self as "a mass of consciousness *alone*" (*vijñānaghana eva*). The opponent insists that the word "alone" (*eva*) explicitly excludes everything other than pure consciousness, thereby negating the self's status as a knower.

The commentary refutes this by analyzing the analogy used in the scripture itself:

The scripture states: "Just as a lump of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is entirely a mass of taste, so indeed is this self, having neither inside nor outside, but is entirely a mass of consciousness."

The commentator explains that the purpose of the analogy of the salt crystal (*saindhavaghana*) is to demonstrate that the self is conscious *through and through*. Just as there is no part of the salt crystal that is not salty, there is no part of the self that is non-conscious or inert (*jaḍa*). The term "alone" (*eva*) serves to exclude any possibility of the self being partially inert. It does not exclude other properties compatible with consciousness, such as being a knower. After all, when we say a salt crystal is "a mass of taste alone," we are not denying that it also has color, texture, and shape. We are only emphasizing that its entire being is pervaded by saltiness. Similarly, the self is entirely pervaded by consciousness, leaving no room for any non-luminous aspect.

### The Proof of the Self's Self-Luminosity

Having established the self as a knower whose nature is consciousness, the commentary turns to prove its fundamental attribute of self-luminosity (*svaprakāśatva*).

**Verse 76:** **The self is established by itself alone (*svenaiva siddhyati*) as "I," for the scriptures declare it to be self-luminous (*svayaṃjyotiḥ*). Even in deep sleep (*svāpe*), its self-existence is established, as proven by the unimpaired recognition (*pratyabhijñā*) upon waking: "I slept happily."**

The commentary presents three proofs for the self's self-luminosity:

1.  **Scriptural Authority (*Nigama*):** The self's self-luminosity is explicitly stated in scriptures such as the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad*, which says, "Here, this person becomes self-luminous" (*atrāyaṃ puruṣaḥ svayaṃjyotirbhavati*) (6.3.9) and "The person is the light within the heart" (*hṛdyantarjyotiḥ puruṣaḥ*) (6.3.7). This provides direct textual evidence.

2.  **The Nature of "I"-Consciousness:** The self is directly and immediately manifest to everyone in the form of "I" (*aham iti*). This "I"-consciousness does not depend on any other instrument or act of knowledge for its own existence to be known. It is self-established (*svenaiva siddhyati*). While the self of another person must be known through inference or testimony, one's own self is always self-evident.

3.  **The Evidence from Deep Sleep (*Suṣupti*):** The most powerful proof comes from the memory we have after waking from dreamless sleep. Upon waking, a person has the direct recognition (*pratyabhijñā*), "I slept happily." This statement contains three components:
    *   **"I"**: The subject who persisted through sleep.
    *   **"Slept"**: The state itself.
    *   **"Happily"**: The quality of the experience.

    This memory would be impossible if the "I" had ceased to exist or ceased to be conscious during sleep. For a memory to form, there must have been a conscious experiencer present during the event. Since the mind and senses are completely inactive in deep sleep, the "I" must have been present and aware through its own intrinsic luminosity, without the aid of any instruments. The continuous, self-aware existence of the experiencer ("I") is thus proven, establishing that the self is inherently self-luminous.
