Here is an exposition of the philosophical argument from the provided text, following the principles outlined.

### **Exposition of Tattvamuktākalāpa, Verse 171 & 26, with Commentary**

This passage from K.S. Varadacharya's commentary on Vedanta Desika's *Tattvamuktākalāpa* addresses a foundational problem in Vedanta: how Brahman can be both the efficient cause (*nimitta-kāraṇa*) and the material cause (*upādāna-kāraṇa*) of the universe without compromising its perfect nature.

**The Preceding Argument**

The commentary begins by summarizing the established position: Brahman is the non-distinct efficient and material cause (*abhinna-nimitta-upādāna*). It is the material cause because the emergence of the gross world-state involves an inevitable change—consistent with their respective natures—in both Brahman’s qualifiers (the sentient and insentient beings) and in Brahman as the qualified subject. It is the efficient cause because it possesses the will (*saṅkalpa*) that is conducive to bringing about the effect (the world). Thus, the doctrine is coherent.

At this point, the commentator dismisses a "childish question" asking for a formal grammatical analysis of the compound term *abhinna-nimitta-upādāna*. He asserts the term's validity with a "lion's roar" of a verse: "We do not consider those to be true grammarians who, in an assembly of scholars versed in various grammars, declare a word to be ungrammatical."

### **Verse 171: Establishing the Principle with Analogies**

The core philosophical objection is then raised: how can one and the same entity be both the material cause and the efficient cause? The two roles seem contradictory. An objector suggests a counter-example: a stick is the efficient cause of a pot, but it is the material cause only of its *own* qualities, like its color. The commentator clarifies the real challenge: “O Logician (*tārkika*), you have misunderstood the intent! The question is how a single entity can be both the material and efficient cause *with respect to the very same effect*.”

To answer this, Vedanta Desika provides two examples in the verse:

> **कर्तोपादानमेव स्वसुखमुखगुणे स्वप्रयत्नप्रसूते**
> **संयोगं स्वस्य मूर्तेः स्वयमुपजनयन्नीश्वरोऽप्येवमिष्टः ॥ १७१ ॥**
>
> **An agent is indeed the material cause (*upādāna*) of qualities like its own happiness, which are produced by its own effort. Likewise, even God (*Īśvara*) is accepted to be both agent and material cause when, by His own will, He generates His conjunction with a corporeal object.**

**Commentary on Verse 171**

**1. The Example of the Individual Self (Jīva):**

A conscious agent is the material cause of its own happiness (*svasukhamukhaguṇe*) when that happiness is produced by its own effort (*svaprayatnaprasūte*). For instance, although scripture may say that happiness and suffering often come unbidden, the specific happiness generated by an act like eating is dependent on effort. In this case:
*   The agent is the **efficient cause** because it undertakes the effort (the act of eating).
*   The agent is the **material cause** because the resulting happiness is a quality that inheres in the agent itself.

Thus, for the single effect of "happiness-produced-by-effort," the individual self is simultaneously the efficient and material cause. There is no contradiction.

**2. The Example of God (Īśvara):**

An objector might argue: "This applies to the individual self who acts through effort, but God's creativity proceeds from will (*saṅkalpa*) alone. How does this apply to Him?"

The verse answers this by pointing to the effect of conjunction (*saṃyoga*). Even God (*Īśvara*) is accepted by opponents like the logicians (Naiyāyikas) to be both causes in the following scenario:
*   When a new object like a pot is created, God, being all-pervading (*vibhu*), inevitably enters into a state of conjunction (*saṃyoga*) with it.
*   God is the **efficient cause** of this conjunction because He creates it through His own will.
*   God is also the **material cause** of this conjunction, as conjunction is a quality that now inheres in God as one of its relata.

The commentator notes that the verse specifies conjunction with a *corporeal* object (*mūrteḥ*) because the Naiyāyika school does not accept a conjunction between two all-pervading entities. The reason conjunction is chosen as the example, rather than God’s bliss, is that God’s bliss is eternal and uncaused (*nitya*), whereas conjunction is a generated effect (*janya*).

**Refining the Argument:**

The commentary then delves deeper. An objector points out that the individual self's happiness is merely a state-change (*avasthāviśeṣa*) of its eternal attributive consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*), so its "production" is only metaphorical. If this is the case, then even God's qualities, like the compassion He feels upon seeing a devotee's suffering (as described in texts like *“He becomes deeply grieved in the sorrows of men”*), must also be considered newly arising states.

The commentator concedes this but draws a crucial distinction. The eternality of the *jīva’s* consciousness is a truth known only from scripture (*śāstra*), while its empirical expansion and contraction (e.g., in deep sleep) are common experience. For God, however, *everything* about His nature is known only through scripture, and His consciousness is eternally free from contraction and expansion. Therefore, to construct an argument that is logically sound and acceptable even to an opponent like a logician, the universally acknowledged, non-controversial example of conjunction (*saṃyoga*) was chosen.

### **Verse 26: Applying the Principle to the Universe**

Having established that a single entity can be both cause types for an insubstantial effect like conjunction, the next objection arises: How can this apply to God being the material cause of the entire *substantial* cosmos?

> **सर्वोपादानभावः स्वत इह घटते सर्वकर्तर्यमुष्मिन्**
> **सर्वश्रुत्यैकरस्यप्रणयिभिरुचितं द्वारमत्राभ्युपेतम् ॥ २६ ॥**
>
> **Therefore, the status of being the material cause of all things (*sarvopādāna-bhāva*) arises naturally for that Universal Agent. And in this matter, an appropriate intermediary (*dvāram*) is accepted by us who are committed to the unified meaning of all scriptures.**

**Commentary on Verse 26**

**1. Brahman as the Universal Material Cause:**

The status of being the material cause of everything (*sarvopādānabhāva*) is fitting for that universal agent (*sarvakartari*), Brahman, precisely because He is the cause of everything. Scriptural passages such as *"From which, verily, all these beings are born..."* (Taittirīya Upaniṣad 3.1.1) establish Brahman as the basis for the universe's creation, sustenance, and dissolution. To be the ground into which the universe dissolves (*laya*) is impossible without being its material cause. This is further supported by the *Brahma Sūtras*, which state that Brahman creates "by making Himself" (*ātmakṛteḥ*, B.S. 1.4.26) and "through transformation" (*pariṇāmāt*, B.S. 1.4.27).

**2. The Solution: An Intermediary (Dvāram):**

This leads to the most critical problem: If Brahman transforms directly into the world, wouldn't He become subject to the flaws, imperfections, and inertness of the non-sentient world (*acit*)?

The second half of the verse provides the definitive solution of Viśiṣṭādvaita. "We, who are committed to harmonizing all scriptures (*sarvaśrutyaikarasyapraṇayibhiḥ*), accept an appropriate intermediary (*dvāram*) in this material causality."
*   This intermediary is the entire cosmos of sentient (*cit*) and non-sentient (*acit*) entities, which together constitute the **body of Brahman** (*śarīra*).
*   The gross material transformations (*sthūla-pariṇāma*) happen *through* this body. The change occurs *in* the sentient and insentient entities.
*   Brahman's "transformation" consists in being the inner controller (*antaryāmin*) who wills and presides over these changes in His body.

This doctrine of the body-soul relationship (*śarīra-śarīri-bhāva*) elegantly reconciles the *Brahma Sūtra* "because of transformation" (*pariṇāmāt*) with Brahman's absolute perfection. Brahman is the material cause because the material undergoing transformation (the world of cit and acit) is His body and is inseparable from Him. Yet, He remains untouched by the flaws of that transformation, just as the soul is not subject to the imperfections of its physical body.

This solution is presented not as a mere philosophical invention, but as the only way to resolve the apparent contradiction between scriptural texts that affirm Brahman's identity with the world and those that affirm its absolute difference and perfection.
