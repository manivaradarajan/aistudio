Excellent. This is a superb framework for a high-fidelity philosophical translation. Here is an exposition of the argument from K.S. Varadacharya's commentary on Tattva Mukta Kalapa, verse 61, following your specified principles.

### The Unfolding of Consciousness in Liberation is Eternal

**Verse 61:** That expansion of consciousness which fully comprehends the reality of Brahman, adorned with all its attributes—if it existed before, then liberation would be eternal [i.e., there would be no bondage]. If not, how could it escape being perishable? [We reply:] This is incorrect. For us, it is like posterior non-existence is for you. Following the principle articulated by Śaunaka and others, once all offenses are pacified, no cause for the contraction [of consciousness] can ever arise again.

#### Exposition of the Commentary

The commentator, K.S. Varadacharya, begins by clarifying the subject under discussion. Following the soul's journey after departing the body, the text now considers the nature of its ultimate attainment (*prāpti*): the attainment of Brahman, which is liberation (*mukti*). This state is defined as the complete expansion (*vikāsa*) of the soul's innate consciousness, which occurs upon the total cessation of ignorance (*avidyā*).

The argument immediately confronts a foundational dilemma concerning the nature of this cognitive expansion, raised by a philosophical opponent.

**1. The Opponent's Dilemma: A Challenge to the Permanence of Liberation**

The opponent presents a logical trap with two horns:

1.  **If the expansion existed before liberation:** If this full expansion of consciousness—defined as that which has "devoured" or completely apprehended (*kabalita*) the reality of Brahman adorned (*upaskṛta*) with all its infinite attributes—was present even during the state of worldly bondage (*saṃsāra*), then liberation would be an eternal, constant state (*nityamukti*). If this were true, no soul would ever have been in bondage to begin with. This conclusion is contradicted by universal experience.

2.  **If the expansion is newly produced at the moment of liberation:** If, on the other hand, this expansion is a new event that comes into being, then it must be non-eternal and subject to destruction. This follows the inexorable principle that "whatever is born is certain to die" (*jātasya hi dhruvo mṛtyuḥ*). If liberation is a temporary state, it fails to be the ultimate human goal (*paramapuruṣārtha*).

Thus, the opponent argues, the very concept of a permanent liberation characterized by a complete expansion of consciousness is logically untenable.

**2. The Initial Resolution: Analogy and Authoritative Support**

The commentator refutes this dilemma, beginning with the words "This is incorrect" (*maivam*). The solution lies in understanding the unique nature of this expansion.

He first draws a powerful analogy aimed at a logician (likely of the Nyāya school): the expansion of consciousness is like posterior non-existence (*pradhvaṃsābhāva*) in your own system. Posterior non-existence—for example, the absence of a pot after it is smashed—has a definite beginning in time, yet it is considered eternal because the pot will never exist again. Similarly, the expansion of consciousness is an event that is "produced" upon the destruction of karmic obstacles, but it is eternal because those obstacles will never return.

To support this, the commentator invokes the teaching of authorities like Śaunaka, as found in the *Viṣṇu Dharma Purāṇa*:

> "Just as the brilliance of a gem is not *created* by washing away dirt but is merely revealed, so too knowledge is not *created* for the self by the removal of its faults... Just as water and sky are not *created* by the act of digging a well but are merely made manifest (for how can something come from nothing?), so too the qualities of consciousness and bliss are *revealed* by the destruction of negative qualities. They are not generated, for they are eternally intrinsic to the self."

This principle establishes that the expansion is not a new production but the manifestation of an eternal, natural state.

**3. Refining the Argument: Expansion as the Cessation of Contraction**

The commentary then deepens this reasoning. In our system, Varadacharya notes, we hold that non-existence (*abhāva*) is not a separate category but is simply a different form of existence (*bhāvāntararūpatva*). Therefore, the expansion (*vikāsa*) of consciousness is nothing other than the cessation or destruction of its contraction (*saṅkocanivṛtti*). Since the expansion *is* itself a form of destruction (the destruction of limitation), it can logically be both produced (as it has a beginning) and eternal (as it has no end), just like posterior non-existence.

He offers another analogy: the nature of light from a lamp is to spread (*prasaraṇa*). Its non-spreading, or contraction (*saṅkoca*), is not intrinsic to it but is caused by an external, limiting factor (*aupādhika*) like a wall. Once the obstruction is removed, the light naturally and spontaneously expands. Likewise, the soul’s attributive consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*) is inherently expansive. Its contraction is caused by the obstructions of karma. When karma is destroyed at liberation, the consciousness expands to its natural, limitless state. Because this expansion is its innate nature (*svābhāvika*), and a natural state cannot be undone, this expansion never recedes.

**4. Why a Temporary Expansion is Unacceptable**

At this point, the commentator anticipates a subtle counter-objection: "If you admit that the expansion is an adventitious state, why not just concede that it is temporary? As long as the underlying substance of consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*) remains eternal, what is the harm?"

Varadacharya's reply is crucial, for it clarifies the very definition of the ultimate goal. He argues that merely preserving the eternity of the *substance* of consciousness is not our ultimate aim, because that substance exists even during bondage. The ultimate human goal (*paramapuruṣārtha*) is not just the existence of consciousness, but its complete and unimpeded function: the full experience of Brahman. This experience *is* the expansion. Therefore, if the expansion were temporary, the achievement of the ultimate goal would be temporary. Liberation is defined precisely by this state of "devouring the entire reality of Brahman" (*kabalitanikhilopaskṛtabrahmatattvaḥ*), a state made possible only by its full and permanent expansion. As the revered teacher Rāmānuja states, the experts in Vedānta define liberation as "the natural experience of the Supreme Self, preceded by the destruction of ignorance."

**5. Reconciling Logic and Doctrine**

The opponent, however, might press the formal logical point again: "You still haven't escaped the rule that a produced positive entity (*bhāva*) is necessarily non-eternal."

The commentator responds with a logician's precision.

*   **First, a formal refinement:** Just as you refine rules to protect your own doctrines—for example, by qualifying the rule to say "a produced *positive* entity" to exempt eternal destruction (*dhvaṃsa*)—we can make similar adjustments.
*   **A more robust solution:** If you feel such a move is ad-hoc, we can offer a better refinement of the universal rule: "A produced *substance* (*dravya*) is necessarily non-eternal." Since the expansion (*vikāsa*) is a state or mode (*avasthā*), not a substance, it is exempt from this rule.
*   **Accepting a qualified non-eternity:** The opponent might then ask: "If the expansion is a temporary state, doesn't that make the consciousness qualified by that state non-eternal?" The commentator boldly replies, "We welcome that consequence!" (*iṣṭāpatteḥ*). He uses the analogy of cosmic space (*ākāśa*). Space itself is eternal, but "pot-space" (*ghaṭākāśa*)—space as qualified by its conjunction with a pot—is temporary and ceases when the pot breaks. The non-eternity of the *qualified entity* does not compromise the eternity of the underlying substance. So too, the consciousness-in-bondage is a qualified state that ceases, and the consciousness-in-liberation is a qualified state that begins, but the underlying consciousness-substance is eternal throughout.

Therefore, the expansion (*vikāsa*) must be understood as an adventitious state (*avasthā*). To claim it was always present in its full form would be to fall into a view similar to Sāṃkhya *satkāryavāda* (where the effect pre-exists in the cause), which would incorrectly make the expansion itself a substance.

**6. Securing the Final State: The Role of Insight over Literalism**

Finally, Varadacharya argues that the permanence of this liberated state is guaranteed because the cause of contraction—namely, karma—has been utterly and permanently destroyed. With the cause gone, the effect (contraction) can never return. He advises that on such matters, true philosophical insight (*vijñāna*) is more decisive than a mere "word search" (*vacana-anveṣaṇa*) through scripture. As the scripture itself says, the wise have "ascertained the meaning through the deep understanding of Vedānta" (*vedāntavijñānasuniścitārthāḥ*). Sacred texts can sometimes seem to speak in riddles ("the gods love the cryptic"), but direct insight (*vijñāna*) is never misleading. It is through such insight, he concludes, that the finality of liberation and the non-return of the soul to bondage is truly established.
