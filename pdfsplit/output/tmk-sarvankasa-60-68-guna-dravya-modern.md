Excellent. Here is a three-part analysis of the philosophical argument presented in the exposition of K.S. Varadacharya's commentary.

***

### Part 1: What the Author is Really Arguing

#### **Core Thesis and Strategic Situation**

The author's central thesis is that the commonsense distinction between a substance (*dravya*) and its attributes (*guṇa*) is not only experientially grounded but also logically coherent and necessary for any meaningful thought or language.

The strategic situation is a defense of metaphysical realism against the anti-substantialist and phenomenalist critiques of Buddhist philosophy, particularly the Vaibhāṣika school. The argument is not merely academic; it is a foundational defense of the Visiṣṭādvaita worldview, which requires a world of real, distinct entities (God, souls, matter) that are related to one another as substance to attribute or whole to part. If the very concepts of substance and attribute are incoherent, the entire theological and metaphysical system collapses. The author’s goal is to secure the ontological ground on which that system is built.

#### **What Positions is the Author Defending Against?**

The author is systematically dismantling a series of sophisticated Buddhist objections:

1.  **A Bundle Theory of Objects:** The core Vaibhāṣika position is that an object is nothing more than a co-located aggregate (*saṃghāta*) of momentary sensory qualities (smell-atoms, color-atoms, etc.). Based on the principle of "inseparable perception" (*sahopalambhaniyamāt abhedaḥ*), they argue that since we never perceive a substance apart from its qualities, there is no reason to posit a separate substrate.
2.  **A Process Metaphysics of Momentariness (*kṣaṇikatva*):** This doctrine holds that reality is composed of a fleeting series of point-instants. This is used to attack the author's key evidence: the experience of recognition (*pratyabhijñā*). The Buddhist argues that recognition of an enduring object is an illusion, as the object seen at time T1 is numerically different from the object touched at T2.
3.  **The Regress of Predication:** A logical attack on the coherence of properties. The opponent presents a dilemma: Is a property (e.g., "blueness") itself property-less or does it have properties? If property-less, it cannot be spoken of. If it has properties, this leads to an infinite regress (blueness has the property of "blueness-ness," which in turn must have a property, and so on).
4.  **The Dilemma of Inherence:** A logical attack on the relationship between substance and attribute. The opponent asks: Does a property inhere in a substrate that is *already* qualified by it, or in one that is *devoid* of it? The former leads to circularity (a thing being its own foundation), while the latter is a contradiction.

#### **Key Philosophical Moves and the Positive Account**

To defeat these positions, the author makes several key moves that build a positive account of substance realism:

1.  **The Argument from Cross-Modal Recognition:** The author's opening move is phenomenological. The experience "I am touching the very pot I just saw" proves a single, multi-sensory object that is distinct from its sense-specific qualities (visible color, tangible texture). This directly establishes a common substrate (*dravya*) for different attributes (*guṇa*).
2.  **An Epistemology of Default Realism:** To defend recognition against the charge of illusion, the author articulates a crucial principle: an experience is to be considered valid unless it is sublated by a correcting perception (*bādhakapratyaya*) or is known to be caused by a defect (*kāraṇadoṣa*). Since recognition fails neither test, it is "very firm" (*dṛḍhatarā*) and must be accepted as veridical. This shifts the burden of proof to the skeptic.
3.  **The Concept of the Self-Establishing Universal (*svānyanirvāhakatvam*):** This is the brilliant move to halt the infinite regress. The author posits that certain properties (universals, *jāti*) are ontologically special. They have a dual function: they establish the identity of the particular things they qualify (e.g., "cowness" makes a cow a cow) while simultaneously establishing their *own* distinctness from other universals without needing a higher-order property. They are regress-stoppers by nature.
4.  **A Logic of Inherence in the "Substrate-as-such" (*dharmimātre*):** To solve the inherence dilemma, the author makes a fine-grained distinction. A property inheres not in a "bare" particular (a contradictory notion) nor in an "already-qualified" one (a circular notion), but in the *substrate-as-such*—the entity considered in its fundamental reality prior to its relation with that specific property. The property's inherence is precisely what *makes* the substrate qualified.
5.  **A Transcendental/Pragmatic Defense:** The final move is to argue that denying the substance-attribute distinction leads to performative contradiction (*svadhīvāgvihatiḥ*). The very act of forming a judgment or uttering a sentence relies on predication, the structure the opponent seeks to deny. Therefore, the distinction is a precondition for the possibility of coherent thought and speech.

**The resulting positive account** is a robust form of Substance Realism where enduring substances are the bearers of real attributes. This structure is known through experience and defended by a sophisticated logical apparatus that resolves the classic paradoxes of predication and inherence.

### Part 2: Western Philosophical Parallels

#### **Which Debates have the Same Logical Structure?**

The core debate is a direct parallel to the classic Western metaphysical dispute between **Substance Realism and Bundle Theory**.

*   **Substance Realism (Aristotle, Locke):** Posits that objects consist of a substratum or substance that bears properties but is distinct from them.
*   **Bundle Theory (Hume, Russell):** Posits that an object is nothing more than a "bundle" or collection of properties, with no underlying substratum.

Varadacharya's argument also maps directly onto F.H. Bradley's famous **regress argument against the reality of relations**. Bradley argued that any attempt to link a substance (A) to a property (B) with a relation of inherence (R) requires a new relation (R') to link A to R, and so on, leading to an infinite regress that proves the whole structure is illusory. The Buddhist "regress of predication" is a version of this exact logical problem.

#### **Mapping Positions: Which Philosophers Hold Analogous Views?**

*   **Vedanta Desika / K.S. Varadacharya** are defending a position structurally analogous to that of **Aristotle**. For Aristotle, a primary substance (e.g., "this man") is the ultimate subject of predication, the bearer of qualities, quantities, etc., but is not itself predicated of anything else. Varadacharya’s *dravya* functions precisely as an Aristotelian substance.
*   **The Buddhist Opponent** holds a position virtually identical to that of **David Hume**. Hume famously argued that when he introspected, he could never perceive a "self" or "substance," only a stream of individual perceptions (of heat, cold, color, etc.). He concluded that an object is merely "a bundle or collection of different perceptions." This is the exact same reasoning as the Vaibhāṣika principle of "inseparable perception."
*   The author’s solution to the inherence dilemma by positing a **"substrate-as-such" (*dharmimātre*)** is an attempt to theorize what contemporary metaphysicians call a **bare particular**. This is the idea of a substratum that can exist devoid of properties, whose entire role is to provide individuation and serve as a "peg" on which to hang properties. Philosophers like Gustav Bergmann have defended this view.

#### **Where Would this Argument Fit in Contemporary Analytic Philosophy?**

This text would be at the heart of contemporary **analytic metaphysics**, specifically in the subfield of **ontology**. The discussion directly engages with central questions:
*   The problem of universals and particulars.
*   The debate between substratum theory and bundle theory.
*   The nature of predication and instantiation.
*   The problem of infinite regress (Bradley's Regress).

The author’s arguments could be formalized and debated alongside papers by figures like David Armstrong, D.C. Williams, and E.J. Lowe.

#### **Conceptual Innovations Parallel to Modern Developments**

The concept of the **"self-establishing property" (*svānyanirvāhakatvam*)** is a remarkable parallel to modern attempts to solve Bradley's Regress. Contemporary metaphysicians have proposed similar solutions. For example, some argue for "relational tropes" or posit that properties have a "gappy" nature that is "filled" by the object they inhere in, making the relation of instantiation internal to the property itself rather than an external link. Varadacharya’s concept is a highly specified version of such a "regress-stopping" feature, attributing a unique dual-capacity to universals that makes them foundational. It is a sophisticated, ancient solution to a problem that continues to vex modern philosophy.

### Part 3: Critical Assessment

#### **Strengths of the Argument**

1.  **Phenomenological Power:** The argument's starting point—cross-modal recognition—is its greatest strength. It grounds a high-level metaphysical thesis in a simple, universal, and undeniable feature of conscious experience. It forces the anti-realist to deny the plain evidence of their senses.
2.  **Dialectical Mastery:** The author demonstrates an exceptional ability to engage the opponent on their own terms. The critique that "aggregate" (*saṃghāta*) is incoherent within a momentary (*kṣaṇika*) worldview is a devastating internal critique that exposes a deep inconsistency in the opponent's system.
3.  **Logical Creativity:** The concept of *svānyanirvāhakatvam* is not just a defensive move; it's a creative and powerful piece of ontological engineering. It provides an elegant, non-obvious solution to what seems like an intractable logical paradox (the regress of properties).
4.  **Systematic Cohesion:** The argument is not a collection of isolated points. It is a systematic, multi-layered defense that moves from experience (Part 1) to logical coherence (Parts 3 & 4), creating a comprehensive and resilient case.

#### **Potential Weaknesses or Areas Needing Development**

1.  **The Black Box of the "Substrate-as-such":** The argument's weakest point is its reliance on the concept of the *dharmimātre* or "substrate-as-such." Like Locke's "something, I know not what," it is defined purely by its function—to be the bearer of properties. It is epistemically inaccessible and conceptually elusive. A critic would argue that this is a placeholder for a problem, not a solution. The author asserts it as a logical necessity but does not provide a positive account of what it *is*.
2.  **The "Brute Fact" of Self-Establishment:** While *svānyanirvāhakatvam* solves the regress, a skeptic could claim it does so by fiat. To say that universals just *do* have this dual capacity without further explanation can be seen as positing a brute, inexplicable fact at the heart of one's ontology. It stops the regress by declaring it stopped.
3.  **Vulnerability to More Sophisticated Process Philosophy:** The defense of recognition is effective against a simple doctrine of momentariness. However, it is less effective against a more sophisticated process philosopher (like Alfred North Whitehead) who might grant the continuity of experience but explain it via causal inheritance from one momentary "occasion of experience" to the next, creating a phenomenal continuity that *simulates* an enduring substance without requiring one.

#### **Lasting Philosophical Contribution**

Regardless of whether one accepts its conclusions, the argument's contribution is immense.

1.  **A Paradigm of Metaphysical Argumentation:** The text is a masterclass in how to construct a metaphysical argument. It demonstrates how to ground abstract claims in concrete experience, how to anticipate and neutralize counter-arguments with logical precision, and how to build a positive theory that is both coherent and explanatorily powerful.
2.  **The enduring relevance of the Substratum/Bundle Debate:** It shows that the fundamental questions of metaphysics—what is a thing? what is a property? how do they relate?—are perennial and cross-cultural. The logical space of possible answers is remarkably stable across traditions.
3.  **The Introduction of *Svānyanirvāhakatvam*:** This concept is a significant contribution to philosophical ontology. It is a specific, technically sophisticated proposal for how reality can be structured and complex without collapsing into an infinite regress. It enriches the set of tools available to any philosopher, East or West, working on the nature of properties and relations. It demonstrates that properties need not be ontologically uniform; some may play a special, foundational role in structuring reality.
