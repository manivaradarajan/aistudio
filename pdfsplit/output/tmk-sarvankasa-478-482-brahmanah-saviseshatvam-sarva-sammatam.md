This commentary by K.S. Varadacharya offers an exposition of Vedanta Desika's critique of various Vedanta schools concerning Brahman as the cause of the universe. The central argument is that even schools claiming Brahman is unqualified (*nirviśeṣa*) are forced to posit some form of qualification to explain creation, thereby tacitly affirming a qualified Brahman. The commentary systematically examines and refutes three major rival theories before establishing the Viśiṣṭādvaita position.

### The Universal, Implicit Acceptance of a Qualified Brahman

The discussion begins with Vedanta Desika's verse (172), which surveys the philosophical landscape:

> Some say Brahman is associated with ignorance (*sāvidyam*); others, that it is associated with limiting conditions (*sopādhikam*); and still others, that it is endowed with powers (*śaktibhir juṣṭam*). Having accepted one of these, they all interpret the scripture declaring Brahman "one without a second" (*ekam evādvitīyam*) as ultimately referring to a *qualified unity* (*tadviśiṣṭaikyaniṣṭhām*).

This verse makes a powerful claim: to function as the material cause of the world, a purely attributeless Brahman is insufficient. Every major school is compelled to introduce a mediating principle—be it ignorance, limiting conditions, or inherent powers. In doing so, they concede that the "oneness" described in scripture is not that of a bare, abstract entity, but the oneness of an entity that is inherently qualified.

The commentary now unpacks and critiques these three positions.

#### 1. The Advaita Position: Brahman Qualified by Ignorance (*Avidyā*)

The first view, held by proponents of unqualified non-dualism (*nirviśeṣādvaita*), posits that Brahman qualified by ignorance (*avidyā*) is the material cause of the universe. They reason that if Brahman in its pure, eternal, and conscious nature were the cause, it would be subject to change and imperfection, making liberation impossible. Therefore, they introduce an inexplicable (*anirvacanīya*) entity called *avidyā* that stands between pure Brahman and the world. The scriptural declaration "one without a second" is upheld, they claim, because *avidyā* is ultimately illusory (*mithyā*), meaning there is no *second real entity* apart from Brahman.

**Critique of the Advaita Position:**

The commentator immediately probes the logical coherence of this solution. The "without a second" (*advitīya*) principle is understood to negate three kinds of difference: from things of the same kind (*sajātīya*), from things of a different kind (*vijātīya*), and internal distinctions (*svagata-bheda*).

The key question is: What is the status of *avidyā* relative to Brahman?

1.  Is *avidyā* of the **same kind** (*sajātīya*) as Brahman? This is impossible, as it would mean there are two Brahmans, shattering non-dualism.
2.  Is *avidyā* of a **different kind** (*vijātīya*)? If so, then Brahman is qualified by an entity of a different kind, directly contradicting the principle that Brahman is "without a second" (which denies heterogenous difference).

The Advaitin objects: The scripture only denies a *real* (*pāramārthika*) second entity. Since *avidyā* is illusory and inexplicable (*anirvacanīya*), it doesn't count.

The commentator dismisses this as a semantic evasion. If "without a second" means "without a *definable* second," this implies that Brahman itself is definable, which Advaitins deny (claiming it is beyond speech, *avācya*). If one claims that Brahman's inexplicability is of a different sort than *avidyā*'s inexplicability, the commentator charges them with making up rules at will: "You have a mouth, you have strength, and you have infinite audacity. Let everything be inexplicable by your own whim!"

#### 2. The Bhāskara Position: Brahman with Real Limiting Conditions (*Upādhi*)

To avoid the logical pitfalls of an "inexplicable" *avidyā*, the philosopher Bhāskara proposes that the limiting conditions (*upādhis*) that differentiate Brahman into the world and souls are **real**.

**Bhāskara's Reasoning:**

The concept of an illusory *avidyā* requires a consciousness that is deluded. Who is deluded? Brahman. Is this delusion natural to Brahman or is it caused by a limiting condition (*upādhi*)?
- If it is **natural**, liberation is impossible.
- If it is caused by an **upādhi**, is that *upādhi* itself real or illusory?
  - If illusory, one needs another cause for that illusion, leading to an infinite regress (*anavasthā*).
  - Therefore, the *upādhi* must be **real**. It is more logical to accept the reality of the conditioning principle from the start than to get caught in this regress.

But how can this co-exist with the "without a second" scripture? Bhāskara argues that the non-dual principle only denies a second entity of the *same kind* as Brahman. Since the *upādhis* (like matter) are inert (*jaḍa*) and of a lower order of reality, their existence does not create a "second Brahman." This view is supported by scriptures like "the reality of the real" (*satyasya satyam*, Bṛ. Up. 2.3.6), which suggests a hierarchy of reality. Brahman possesses unconditional reality (*nirupādhika sattā*), while the world and souls possess a conditioned reality (*sopādhika sattā*).

**Critique of Bhāskara's Position:**

While this avoids the problems of *avidyā*, it creates a new one. In this model, the difference between the individual soul (*jīva*) and Brahman is merely conditional (*aupādhika*), while their non-difference (*abheda*) is natural and ultimate. This implies that the real suffering and imperfections of the souls would ultimately affect Brahman itself, which contradicts the numerous scriptures declaring Brahman to be flawless (*niravadya*).

#### 3. The Yādavaprakāśa Position: Both Difference and Non-Difference are Real (*Bhedābheda*)

To resolve the issue of Brahman being tainted by the soul's defects, Yādavaprakāśa proposes that both difference (*bheda*) and non-difference (*abheda*) between Brahman, souls, and matter are equally **natural and real** (*svābhāvika*).

**Yādavaprakāśa's Model:**

Brahman is a single substance that naturally transforms itself into three aspects or powers (*śakti*): conscious souls (*cit*), non-conscious matter (*acit*), and the manifest Lord (*Īśvara*). Just as a single ocean manifests as distinct waves, foam, and bubbles, Brahman manifests as this triad. The "one without a second" scripture is interpreted as referring to the unity of Brahman as the single substance qualified by these three real transformations.

**Critique of Yādavaprakāśa's Position:**

The commentator, quoting Rāmānuja, calls this theory "even more pernicious (*pāpīyān*) than the theory of Brahman's ignorance."

- In the Advaita view, the world's defects are illusory (*mithyā*), so Brahman's purity is preserved.
- In Yādavaprakāśa's view, the defects are **real**. Since the non-difference between souls and Brahman is also real and natural, the real flaws of the souls must inevitably apply to Brahman.

The defender of this view might argue that the co-existing principle of *difference* would act as a barrier, preventing the transfer of defects. But the commentator retorts: "That may be your wish, but who will enforce your command? Why shouldn't the opposite happen?" That is, why shouldn't the principle of non-difference ensure that the defects *do* transfer? The theory rests on a fundamental, unresolvable contradiction.

This is brought into sharp focus by a final, decisive critique. The commentator argues that if you accept that Brahman is both different from and non-different from its effects, you lose any ground to criticize the Jaina doctrine of seven-fold predication (*saptabhaṅgī*). The *saptabhaṅgī* (e.g., a thing 'is', 'is not', 'is and is not', etc.) was viewed by orthodox schools as the epitome of logical contradiction. By accepting inherent contradiction as foundational to reality, the *bhedābheda* theory becomes philosophically indistinguishable from a system it would otherwise reject.

### The Viśiṣṭādvaita Solution: The Body-Soul Relationship

Having dismantled the major alternative theories, the commentary presents the Viśiṣṭādvaita position as the coherent solution. What "crime," asks Vedanta Desika (Verse 27), have we committed by simply adhering to what is clearly established in scripture (*śāstraprathitam*)? This includes:

1.  The **eternality** of both matter (*prakṛti*) and souls (*puruṣa*).
2.  Their status as the **body** (*śarīra*) of the Supreme Self (*Paramātman*).
3.  Brahman's causality as both the efficient and material cause (*abhinna-nimittopādāna-kāraṇa*).
4.  Brahman's essential nature as being **perpetually qualified** by souls and matter as Its body.

This framework, known as the body-soul model (*śarīra-śarīri-bhāva*), resolves the dilemmas faced by other schools. Souls and matter are distinct and real, so their imperfections do not taint Brahman (solving Bhāskara's problem). Yet they are inseparably dependent on Brahman as its body, mode, and attribute. This inseparable relationship justifies scriptural **statements of non-difference** (*abhedanirdeśa*), such as "You are That" (*tat tvam asi*), without necessitating ontological identity.

The commentator makes a crucial distinction: the claim is not that non-difference *is caused by* the body-soul relationship, but that *statements* of non-difference are *justified by* it. Just as one says "I am tall," identifying the self with a quality of the body, scripture identifies Brahman with the cosmos because the cosmos is Its body. This allows all scriptures—those asserting difference and those asserting unity—to be harmonized without contradiction.
