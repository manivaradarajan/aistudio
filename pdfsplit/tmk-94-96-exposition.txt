# On the Identity of Material Cause and Effect

## The Evidence for Non-Difference Between Material Cause and Product

**Verse 22**: Recognition (pratyabhijñā) reveals the identity of substance even when there is difference in measure, because we do not cognize something distinct. [The opponent argues:] Even something capable of increase or decrease of parts can be one in the manner of a heap.

The text begins with a fundamental question: Is a clay pot merely the clay in a different arrangement, or is it something entirely new that has come into existence? This is the ancient dispute between sat-kārya-vāda (the effect pre-exists in the cause) and asat-kārya-vāda (the effect is newly produced).

## The Vaiśeṣika Position on Wholes

The Vaiśeṣika philosophers offer an intermediate view. They say: Yes, a cloth comes into existence, but only when there is a specific, distinctive conjunction (vilakṣaṇa-saṃyoga) of threads interwoven together. This is common ground between schools. That very distinctive conjunction is what accounts for our use of the word "cloth." Threads qualified by that distinctive conjunction—threads that have attained a particular state—are what we call "cloth."

Therefore, from this distinctive conjunction—which in Vaiśeṣika thought is accepted as the non-inherent cause (asamavāyi-kāraṇa)—we get talk of composites as assemblies, heaps, forests, and so on. This includes observable examples and the theoretically posited composite. The composite (avayavī) is the theoretically posited entity; the others are observable examples: an assembly, a heap, a forest (the word "and so on" includes garlands and such). Even in these cases, the Vaiśeṣikas do not accept a composite that exists over and above its parts. Flowers qualified by a distinctive conjunction—that's what a garland is. Why shouldn't the same hold for pots, cloths, and the rest?

Since such a distinctive conjunction did not exist before, and since it is generated by the activity of an agent, the agent's activity is not pointless. This also accounts for the difference in states. In the causal state, such a distinctive conjunction is not present; in the effect state, it is generated through the agent's activities. Therefore, the mere collection of causes is not the effect. Rather, the material causes qualified by a distinctive state in the form of conjunction—that becomes the effect. This is precisely how the novelty of the effect, as qualified by such conjunction, is established. With this much explanation, there is no composite existing apart from its parts.

## The Problem of Unclean Nourishment

But wait—doesn't this lead to the paradox of the beautiful nun (subhagā-bhikṣu-nyāya)? If distinctive conjunctions of parts did not exist before, how is asat-kārya-vāda refuted? The answer is: Even though states did not exist before, the substance (dravya) that is their substrate did exist—therefore sat-kārya-vāda holds.

This answer is like "when asked about mangoes, he speaks of kovidāra trees." If you're going to affirm sat-kārya-vāda by taking substance as primary, then by taking state as primary, you must also accept asat-kārya-vāda! Not so—because states are necessarily dependent on substances, and substances have primacy, sat-kārya-vāda alone is correct.

But you might say: "In the form qualified by a particular state, the substance simply did not exist." True. This is why we have repeatedly said: We are neither sat-kārya-vādins in the Sāṅkhya sense, nor asat-kārya-vādins in the Vaiśeṣika sense, but rather middle-ground transformation-theorists (madhyastha-pariṇāma-vādin).

## Recognition as Evidence

Having presented objections to the theory of composites existing beyond their parts, the text now offers positive evidence for their non-difference: the verse beginning "dravyaikyam..."

Even when there is difference in measure (parimiti-antara)—even when size differs—because we do not cognize something distinct (anya-apratīti), recognition (pratyabhijñā) in the form "this is that very thing" reveals the identity of substance (dravya-aikya) between material cause and product.

Consider a leather pouch or ball: through contraction and expansion we see differences in measure—occupying less or more space—yet everyone experiences the recognition "this is that very thing," an apprehension of identity. Therefore there is no absolute difference between material cause (upādāna) and product (upādeya). The same substance qualified by different states is designated by different terms: "material cause" and "product."

A lump of clay is the material cause; a pot is the product. What this means is: clay qualified by the state of being a lump is the material cause; clay qualified by the state of being a pot is the product. What exists beyond this? Therefore, there is merely a difference of state, not a difference of substance.

## The Challenge of Impure Transformations

But if you accept the identity of material cause and product, doesn't this lead to problems? Crops are nourished by impure village refuse (grāma-sāra). The rice and such that grows there, being transformations of that refuse and non-different from it, would make refined people (śiṣṭa) require purification rituals after eating them!

You might say: "In our system, unlike in Sāṅkhya, we don't accept absolute non-difference between material cause and product, so there's no problem."

What can we say to one who's satisfied with this? Let there be no Sāṅkhya-type problem. But there's a different problem—how do you avoid the need for purification? Therefore asat-kārya-vāda alone accords with dharma-śāstra!

No—merely changing terminology doesn't make the scientifically observable fact of nourishment by village refuse disappear. But here is the crucial distinction:

The transformation of clay into pot and such is directly observed. The recognition "this pot is clay" is established by universal experience. But in the case of crop transformation, no such transformation occurs. The living beings present in crops—drawing up through their roots the village refuse given for their nourishment, transforming that refuse in wondrous ways according to their own nature, displaying varied forms, tastes, and smells—what magic they perform! Everyone must stand in silent wonder.

That the varied flowers, fruits, and such of various crops are transformations of village refuse—what unhinged person could prattle on about this as a scientific fact? Yet the scientific truth there does not produce even the slightest recognition of identity of substance—this is astonishing. But scientists know this.

Similarly, this world, though it is indeed a transformation of Brahman replete with varied wondrous powers, is not known or recognized as such by those with merely physical eyes. But those endowed with knowledge and understanding know and recognize "All this is indeed Brahman" (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.1) and rejoice. When one has vision of Brahman as the Self of all, how could there be memory of body and such?

The revered Śaṅkarācārya designated precisely such distinctive transformation as "vivarta" (apparent transformation)—this is our considered position. Therefore, since there is no recognition of identity in crops and fruits, there is no question of purification rituals.

## The Degrees of Transformation

But even without recognition, wouldn't the actual identity of things make ritual consequence unavoidable?

No fault whatsoever—because the transformation of village refuse into flowers and fruits is utterly different in kind from the transformation of clay into pot. The living being present in each crop, being of the nature of consciousness (caitanya), transforms sound, touch, form, taste, and smell in unprecedented ways, making everything pure before transforming it. Otherwise, even the Ganges would lose its purifying power when mixed with street water.

Compared to this, the transformation of village refuse is utterly distinctive, utterly wonder-inducing for the discriminating. To that extent, the asat-kārya-vāda that denies transformation altogether contradicts science. If you say this just to settle your mind, then settle it somehow. In the end—isn't it remembered: "The mind alone is the cause of bondage and liberation for humans"? Therefore in such vivarta situations, there is no ritual consequence.

How could the nature of reality be otherwise? But it should also be remembered that at mealtime, remembrance of anything other than the Lord is prohibited. Even so, if some unfortunate person should remember village refuse at mealtime, the sin should be expiated by remembering the Lord's glory in the form of such magic—or if that's not possible, by fasting.

## The Scriptural Example

But in scripture, the example given at "As, dear one..." (Chāndogya 6.1.4) is precisely the clay product example, not the crop example!

Because this would be unknowable by all due to its scientific complexity, a well-known example was shown. Or let images of elephants, horses, and deities made from clay serve as examples. Even seeing elephants made of clay, people say "This elephant is absolutely wonderful!" And seeing a deity's image, they see the divine deity before them, not the clay. For those seeing clay, the deity is not there. For those seeing the deity, clay is not there.

By the scriptural statement "From earth, plants; from plants, food" (Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.1), food and such are indeed transformations of earth. What more? Vedānta says the word "anna" (food) is synonymous with earth, as understood in "They created anna" and similar passages.

What more? It is well known that eaten food progressively transforms into plasma, blood, flesh, fat, marrow, and bone. In a mother's body, the mother's blood transforms into milk. A cow's blood transforms into milk. Both are like nectar according to scripture. Otherwise, drinking milk would be drinking blood itself—a great ritual consequence would follow.

If you say asat-kārya-vāda applies even there: Where did that milk come from? You'd have to say "from space!" If you say "God does everything everywhere," let God do it. But what is the material cause? What thing in what form does He make?

Therefore, mere terminology as "asat-kārya-vāda" will not provide self-protection. Transformation-theory (pariṇāma-vāda) is scientific—if you accept it just to satisfy your mind, then as we've said: let it be accepted!

A great mystery exists here—let it be contemplated. In all this time, it has not been resolved by anyone. How it came to be thus cannot be known by anyone. Ask māyā, or else ask the Lord Himself in the form of time.

## The Key Principle

Here is the truth: In transformation situations (pariṇāma-sthala), there is recognition of identity. In vivarta situations, however, the identity of substance is accessible only through understanding, not through perception.

Who except scientists would believe that grains, fruits, flowers and such of crops and trees nourished by village refuse are transformations thereof? Scripture says "From fire, water." Where has the principle "The qualities of the cause pass into the effect" gone? It is precisely here that the entire mystery of creation resides. Due to failure to investigate this, the quarrel of scholars has not been settled even today.

If you ask "Why thus?"—ask māyā, or ask the Lord who is its master. Therefore: When there is recognition of cause in effect, it is pariṇāma (real transformation); when there is no recognition, it is vivarta (apparent transformation)—this alone is proper. More on this later.

Let those investigating the most subtle creation-science know the glory and excellence of the Creator through "He sees his own pleasure, no one else sees it" (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.3.14). Here "his" refers to the Supreme Self mentioned earlier there as "He is the maker," not to the individual soul—there would be a contradiction of meaning. What further evidence is needed for the Supreme Self's capacity to accomplish the impossible than "From fire, water"? How could the transformation of water from fire be recognized by human intellect?

Therefore creation-science is indeed in the form of vivarta, a special kind of transformation. This is the subject of all the adhikaraṇas concerning distinctiveness. Therefore, this world is Brahman-natured in the vision of knowers, in the form of His pleasure. For others, it is Brahman-natured in the vision of science, but merely inert in the vision of the ignorant.

Abandoning preconceptions and such, let such truth be contemplated. Truth-devoted saints who are free from rivalry become the authority here. Having multiplied many words and argued hair-splitting, what benefit has been gained?—let this be considered with self as witness. Even omniscient teachers are certainly indicative through suggestion. We believe they did not make everything completely explicit. The answer must be given by time itself; others are dependent on that. And that time has now come—alas, fate now speaks.

## The Simplicity of Rejecting Separate Wholes

Not accepting a composite beyond its parts achieves ontological economy, as stated in "aṃśūtkarṣa..." The word aṃśu is synonymous with aṃśa (part). Parts (aṃśava) are components (avayava). Their increase (utkarṣa), decrease (kṣaya), and so on—excess and deficiency. Something capable (kṣama) of these. From that—from the very absence of a separate composite—something coarse (sthūla) and singular—what is called the composite—becomes like a heap (rāśivat)—as in a heap of grain and such—even while capable of increase or decrease of parts.

For in the theory of composites existing beyond parts, with the separation or conjunction of even one atom from the composite, the previous composite would be destroyed...
