# Exposition of the Philosophical Argument on Substance and Quality

## The Circular Dependence Objection and Its Resolution

An objection arises: In the creation sequence (sṛṣṭi), sense organs are said to emerge from the ego-principle (ahaṅkāra). But if sense organs only come into being in response to their objects (viṣaya), how can we avoid circular reasoning—the organs depending on objects, and objects depending on organs?

The response: This entire creation sequence concerns the aggregate cosmic principles (samaṣṭi-tattva), not individual instantiation. At that level of analysis, this question simply doesn't arise. Moreover, from that cosmic perspective, each object is explicitly said to be created individually, so the existence of objects beyond any particular sense organ is established without any obstacle.

## The Argument Against Differentiating Principle Based on Cognizer-Difference

Consider this further: If the distinction between form (rūpa) and taste (rasa) depends solely on the difference between their cognizing organs, we face a problem. All forms—white, yellow, and so forth—are grasped by vision alone. Since there's no difference in the cognizer, there should be no distinction between white, blue, yellow, and other forms—all form would collapse into a single form. The same would apply to taste and other qualities: internal distinctions wouldn't be established, since there's no difference in cognizer. Therefore, the distinction between substance (dravya) and quality (guṇa) is established as non-relational (nirupādhika)—not dependent on any external condition.

## The Transformation Objection: Change Implies Material Causation

But wait—an objection arises: In earth-substances like mangoes and jackfruit, we observe transformation (parivṛtti) of form and other qualities through ripening. This is established by universal experience. In such cases, form and other qualities must have the status of effects (kārya)—this cannot be avoided. And if something is an effect, it necessarily requires a material cause (upādāna-kāraṇa). With respect to form and other qualities, substance itself is the material cause.

Now, since substance stands as material cause to quality, and since you yourselves have established (in verse 20) that there is non-difference between material cause and effect (upādāna-upādeya), the non-difference of quality and qualified substance (guṇa-guṇin) is already established. So how can you maintain that qualities exist as distinct from substance?

You might object: "Just because knowledgeable people use the convention of quality-qualified-substance language, and because we don't observe a subsequent temporal contradiction, the distinction between them is established." But this objection fails, since conventional distinction can be maintained even with imaginary entities—just as we speak of "Rāhu's head" (a conventional astronomical entity).

## The Rational Contradiction Argument

The deeper point: Even when material cause and effect are non-different, rational contradiction (yauktika-bādha) can exist even without perceptual contradiction (pratyakṣa-bādha). 

You might counter: "Since perception is stronger, how can reason contradict it?" But everyone accepts the case of "this very flame" (flame-identity perception)—the perception of flame-identity is contradicted by inference. This is universally acknowledged.

But one might respond: "The perception of flame-identity is of the nature of recognition (pratyabhijñā). Recognition is not generated by sense organs alone—it's partially generated by latent impressions (saṃskāra). Therefore this cognition, consisting of grasping and remembering, is not entirely probative. So it's contradicted by reason precisely because it's weak, not because reason can contradict pure perception."

This response fails: We see perception itself being contradicted. The perception "this is silver," which is generated purely by sense organs, is contradicted by the perception "this is shell." Moreover, you can't say the initial cognition isn't generated purely by sense organs because there's no contact with actual silver—and therefore its being contradicted is appropriate. Even granting that...

## The Resolution: Transformation Theory vs. Material Cause Theory

We respond: All this is mere conceptual dancing. The claim that substance is the material cause of quality belongs to Vaiśeṣika doctrine. But in our settled conclusion (siddhānta), we accept the transformation theory (pariṇāma-vāda). According to this: substance qualified by a prior state becomes the material cause of substance qualified by a subsequent state. Form, taste, and so forth are simply state-specifications (avasthā-viśeṣa).

Even in a situation where form transforms through ripening, the substance qualified by the prior form transforms into being qualified by a different form. Therefore, since there's no mere transformation of form alone—since it's the substance-as-qualified-by-that-form which transforms thus—everywhere substance alone is material cause and substance alone is the thing caused. Through the identity of material-cause-and-effect, only the identity of substance is established, not the identity of quality and qualified-substance.

Moreover, since the very relation of material-cause-and-effect is produced by difference, there's no scope for non-difference between substance and quality. Everything else applies at its appropriate juncture.

## The Co-Apprehension Argument Examined

As for the argument "from the invariable rule of co-apprehension (saha-upalambha-niyama), there is non-difference of quality and qualified-substance"—which runs thus: "If there were difference, then sometimes one would be apprehended without the other, just as cloth is apprehended without pot. Since quality and qualified-substance are never apprehended thus separately, there is no difference"—this too is self-contradictory, since the very togetherness (sahatva) contains difference within it.

In darkness, apprehension of pot without form definitely occurs through the tactile organ. Similarly, apprehension of pot without touch definitely occurs in light. Therefore the relation of quality-qualified-substance cannot be denied.

## The Property-Property-Bearer Relation (Verse 9)

**If a property (dharma) is without a property-bearer (dharmin), how could it be fit for designation and other functions? If you say it comes to be so through connection with another property, then there's infinite regress. Therefore no.**

Now, isn't this merely imitating the Buddhist monk's statement: "From the invariable rule of co-apprehension, there is non-difference of blue and the cognition of blue"? 

Fine—but are words the exclusive property of that school alone? Let it also be read: "From the invariable rule of co-apprehension, there is non-difference of blue and the word 'blue.'" Blue here means the referent (artha). Thus, just as with cognition and object, the non-difference doctrine of object and word has co-apprehension-invariance as its sole basis. Similarly with quality and qualified-substance: if there's a non-difference doctrine, co-apprehension alone is the reason.

"Establishment" (siddhi) means both existence and apprehension. By this same principle, since the inseparability (avinābhāva) of individual soul (jīva) and Brahman has part-whole relation (aṃśa-aṃśin-bhāva) as its basis, let it also be read: "From the invariable rule of co-apprehension, there is non-difference of supreme soul and individual soul." Or let it be read universally: "From the invariable rule of co-apprehension, there is non-difference of what are established as inseparable (ayuta-siddha)."

For investigators, among the causes of doctrinal differences rooted in differences of understanding, inseparability-caused co-apprehension-invariance is the primary ground. But since togetherness contains difference, there's no hope of establishing non-difference from co-apprehension-invariance.

## The Body-Embodied Soul Parallel

You might object: "If there's inseparability of body and embodied soul, then like 'the pot is blue,' there should be co-referential apprehension (samānādhikaraṇa-pratīti) of soul and body."

Who says there isn't? The co-referential apprehension "I am a human" definitely exists!

"But that's merely metaphorical apprehension."—This will be examined in the section on the soul.

"If there's inseparability of individual soul and supreme soul, then when one apprehends 'I,' the supreme should also appear."—Who says it doesn't appear? The apprehension "I am Brahman" is itself the evidence. Indeed, in this very doctrine, the experience "I am Brahman" naturally accords with the body-embodied-soul relation, not with the identity-of-essence doctrine. More on this later.

## Schools and Their Interpretations

When cognizing "blue," the Vaibhāṣikas say: blueness alone is the object, not substance. The Sāṃkhyas say: substance alone appears, not quality. Others say: substance-qualified-by-blueness appears. In all these cases, the inseparability of quality and qualified-substance is the foundation.

Similarly, because of the inseparability of individual soul and supreme self, doctrines of difference, non-difference, and difference-and-non-difference have arisen. Moreover, the entailment is: where there is co-apprehension, there is inseparability—not that where there is inseparability, there is co-apprehension. This is because apprehension depends on the capability of the apparatus (sāmagrī). Weight and such qualities are never apprehended together with substance. Similarly, when grasping pot by vision, taste and other qualities aren't grasped by it. So the stated problem doesn't arise.

## The Resolution of Disputes About Inseparability

Thus, in every case of inseparability, such debate is natural. Then what's the resolution? When two things exist, there is inseparability. Therefore inseparability itself manifests both difference and co-apprehension—the resolution is already established. Everything else is mere verbal confusion.

For precisely this reason, we are not proponents of difference-and-non-difference (bhedābheda-vāda). With exactly this in mind, the revered commentator (Śaṅkara) extensively refuted the difference-and-non-difference doctrine in the Harmonization Chapter (Samanvaya-adhikaraṇa).

By this, it should be understood that the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha author's ornamental words—"deposited in the materialist faction through the expedient of three mutually contradictory positions of difference, etc."—arise merely from failure to understand the subtle nature of this settled doctrine, and should be considered mere embellishment. "What offense is greater than abandoning what's well-established in scripture?"—as stated by all discerning people who must necessarily maintain authoritative conventional practices. More should be seen there.

## Addressing Buddhist Objections to Property-Bearer Relations

Having thus addressed impossibilities raised by Buddhists concerning qualifier-qualified relations and similar matters, the author now addresses and resolves another impossibility they've presented, beginning with "property" (dharma).

First the opponent's view is stated, then refuted in the second half. Since the doctrine of substance-with-properties (saviśeṣa-vāda) culminates in the property-property-bearer relation, this relation of property and property-bearer [is now examined]...
