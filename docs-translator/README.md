# AI Document Processor for Google Drive

A tool to automate tasks defined in a Google Doc on files stored in Google Drive, using the Google AI (Gemini) API. This repository contains implementations in both Google Apps Script and Python.

## How It Works

1.  A task is defined under a specific heading in a Google Doc.
2.  The script reads input files from a designated Google Drive folder.
3.  A prompt is constructed with the task and file contents.
4.  The prompt is sent to the Gemini API.
5.  The AI's response is written back to the Google Doc under an output heading.
