**Verse 3**

**Verse Translation**
You are the One Form, the Two Forms, the Three Forms, the Many Forms,
Becoming the five elements, the two great lights, and the subtle inner self.
O Narayana, who mounted the serpent and reclined in the midst of the sea!
Enclosing Your entire form within my heart, the soul’s great suffering was destroyed.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary)**
As the one who possesses a divine, non-material, eternal, and self-existent form, residing in the glorious realm of Vaikuntha, He is the creator of primordial matter, the great principle, the threefold principle of individuation, the mind and other faculties, the five elements, the sun, moon, and all other celestial bodies. For the sake of their sustenance, He remains situated within them as their Inner Controller. For the protection of the world He created, He graciously reclines upon the serpent couch in the middle of the Milk Ocean. “O Narayana! I have come to realize that all the enjoyments required for Your divine body are nothing but my acts of devotion, such as remembrance and bathing in sacred waters. Experiencing this magnificent quality of Yours, my own afflictions have been dispelled,” says the Alvar.

**ப – (12000 Commentary)**
In this verse, the Alvar declares: "By taking refuge in You with my entire being, I have experienced Your form in this way, and my soul has been freed from the suffering that was previously spoken of."

You are the One who possesses the causal form, as described in the scripture "He alone was," qualified by all sentient and insentient beings in their subtle state. You have as Your forms the two principles of **`mahat`** (the great principle) and **`ahaṅkāra`** (the principle of individuation), which are the effects of that unmanifest source. You have as Your modes the imbalance of the three fundamental qualities—purity, passion, and darkness—which are the cause of the threefold nature of **`ahaṅkāra`**. You have as Your modes the eleven senses, which are the effects of the pure (`vaikārika`) principle of individuation. You have as Your modes the five great elements, which are the effects of the dark (`tāmasa` or `bhūtādi`) principle of individuation. You have as Your forms the two lights—the sun and moon, which are exemplars of individualized creation within the cosmic egg. Becoming subtle, You entered into them as their inner Self. For the protection of the beings You created, You mounted the great serpent, Adisesha, and reclined in the middle of the Milk Ocean. O You who are the true subject of the name **Narayana**, a truth established by Your inner controllorship and Your reclining upon the ocean! By enclosing within my heart Your divine form and all Your beauty—which is my offering of all my faculties to serve as every ornament for You—my soul has been freed from the suffering it endured in the previous Tiruvaymoli.

Some commentators propose another interpretation:
*   The verses up to "Many Forms" describe His transcendent (`para`), emanatory (`vyūha`), and incarnate (`vibhava`) forms.
*   "Five elements, the two lights" refers to His connection with the universe of His divine play (`līlāvibhūti`).
In this view:
*   **One Form** is the supreme Vasudeva.
*   **Two Forms** refers to the emanations being of two kinds: one that is eternally manifest and one that is manifest for a specific purpose.
*   **Three Forms** refers to the three eternally manifest forms: Sankarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha.
*   **Many Forms** refers to the twelve secondary emanations, such as Keshava, and the ten primary incarnations.

**ஈடு: – (36000 Commentary)**
In this third verse, the Alvar exclaims, “By making this soul completely Yours, You have finally achieved Your purpose!”

**One Form**: This speaks of the state before creation, as declared in the scripture, “Being alone, my dear, this was in the beginning” (Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1). In that primordial time, the entire cosmos, denoted by the word “this,” lay dissolved. He alone existed as the ultimate reality, with all things resting within Him like the latent glow of a coal covered in ash. It describes that state where He stands as the solitary One. (Alternatively, it can be understood as referring to His unique, personal divine form that exists even before creation.) Thus, this describes the state in which He is poised to begin creation.

**Two Forms**: This describes the state where He gazes upon primordial matter (`prakṛti`) and the great principle (`mahat`), holding them as His divine body. It speaks of Him who has both cause and effect as His body. They are mentioned together because of their profound proximity, for the great principle is but the manifest state of unmanifest matter.

**Three Forms**: This refers to the state where He has the threefold principle of individuation (`ahaṅkāra`) as His body, for that principle is of three kinds: that which is born of purity (`sāttvika`), passion (`rājasa`), and darkness (`tāmasa`).

**Becoming the Many Forms, becoming the five elements**: The sequence mentioned here is not the strict causal progression mentioned before. The effects of the pure principle of individuation are the eleven senses. The effects of the dark principle of individuation are the five elements along with their qualities. The principle of individuation born of passion serves as an auxiliary to the other two. Thus, the verse speaks of the eleven senses and the five elements with their associated qualities, declaring that He possesses all of them as His divine body.

**The two great lights**: As the scripture says, “The Creator fashioned the sun and moon as they were before,” the sun and moon are mentioned here as representatives for the entire class of created effects.

**And the subtle inner self**: After creating all these, He entered into them, as described in the scripture, “Having created it, He then entered into it. Having entered into it, He became both the manifest and the unmanifest” (Taittiriya Upanishad 2.6.1). This speaks of the state where He pervades all things to grant them their existence and their names. One might ask: If this refers to His entry into insentient matter, what about the soul, which is also described as subtle (`aru`)? The answer is that this is also included, for He enters as the Inner Controller of the individual soul, as stated in the scripture, “Entering with this living self…” (Chandogya Upanishad 6.3.2).

**Mounted the serpent**: He reclined upon Adisesha in the middle of the Milk Ocean so that He might be approachable to the created beings, such as Brahma. He is like a farmer who, after cultivating a field, sets up his dwelling right there at the edge of his crops. It can also mean that He reclined there for the protection of all the things He had created.

**O Narayana!**: This name signifies the inherent right He has to be ceaselessly and unfailingly gracious in this manner.

**Enclosing Your entire form within my heart**: The very purpose of creation is this: to make my heart the source of all the sacred unguents, flower garlands, fine garments, and brilliant ornaments needed for Your divine body (`āgam`). This is what has been accomplished.

And who became free from suffering as a result of this act? It was He Himself.

**The soul’s great suffering was destroyed**: The anguish that was in Your divine heart has at last been destroyed! You were so anxious, thinking, “Will I ever be able to bring this soul to a safe shore?” But now that agitation has ceased, and You have become one who has accomplished His purpose!

Alternatively, it can also mean, “My soul has become free of suffering.” However, because this section describes the Lord’s profoundly loving nature (`praṇayitvam`), the cessation of *His* suffering is the most fitting meaning.

There are also those who interpret this verse as describing the transcendent (`para`), emanatory (`vyūha`), and incarnate (`vibhava`) forms. In their view:
*   **One Form** refers to the transcendent Paravāsudeva.
*   **Two Forms** refers to the `vyūha` emanations of Vasudeva and Sankarshana.
*   **Three Forms** refers to the third emanation, Pradyumna.
*   **Many Forms** refers to the incarnate forms.
*   **Five elements, the two lights** refers to the creative acts assigned to Pradyumna.
*   **Mounted the serpent** refers to Aniruddha and his assigned act of protection.
The destructive act assigned to Sankarshana is implied, as creation proceeds from dissolution. This interpretation holds that the verse describes the `vyūha` emanations by describing their designated cosmic functions.
