**Verse Translation**

O beautiful Vamana, who stretched out Your glorious, ankleted feet to take the earth!
O wondrous Lord, who stands ever-present for those who fold their hands to these glorious feet, that they might be united with You!
Though I am unable to praise You, bringing fragrant flowers and water,
Your sacred form of radiant light, which captivates all speech, is fixed upon my very soul.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary)**

The Alvar says: "You descended to protect all who bow to You, performing wondrous divine deeds and making Yourself attainable only through devotion. It is not merely that my acts of service would be enjoyable to You, were I to offer cool, holy, and fragrant flowers, water, and other such things at Your sacred feet. Rather, even when I perform no service at all, Your divine form of radiant light, which is immeasurable by word or mind, finds its very sustenance and enjoyment in the existence of my soul."

**Seventh Verse**

"Even though the love I spoke of before and the services that flow from it are absent in me," says the Alvar, "my very existence has become the source of Your life!"

**[Stretching out Your glorious, ankleted feet]** He stretched forth His sacred feet so that, as another verse says, "He stood encompassing the entire world," bringing the whole expanse of the earth within them. The word *kurai* here signifies both vast expanse and resounding sound.

**[Took the earth, O beautiful Vamana!]** Even after He had measured and taken the earth, the vision of His Vamana form remained deeply imprinted on the Alvar’s heart. The Alvar feels that the Lord took that form not merely to give Indra back his kingdom, but to allow him, the Alvar, to experience His beauty. The first part of this verse speaks of His attainability, while the next part reveals that He can be won by a mere gesture of reverence.

**[For those who fold their hands to Your glorious ankleted feet]** This can be read in two ways:
*   Those who offer a gesture of reverence at Your sacred feet stand united with You.
*   O wondrous Lord, You stand so that those who fold their hands to You may be united with Your glorious ankleted feet.

Indeed, His sacred feet are both the object of reverence and the goal attainable through that reverence. Just as the kingdom was apportioned to Indra, so the beauty of those sacred feet was apportioned to the Alvar. For Indra, the Lord's feet were the means (*sādhana*) to an end; for the Alvar, they became the end (*sādhya*) itself.

**[O wondrous Lord!]** "What a wonder this is! That attaining You requires nothing more than a single gesture of folded hands!" he exclaims.

**[Though I am unable... bringing fragrant flowers and water]** If You are so easily attainable with a mere gesture of reverence, the proper course for a conscious soul would be to perform service with flowers and other offerings. "But I have not been blessed to do so," he laments. "I have been unable to perform the prescribed service with fragrant flowers and water, as enjoined in the scriptures: ‘Let them sprinkle the entire earth with cool, snow-like water.’"

**[Your sacred form of radiant light, which captivates all speech]** The phrase "which captivates speech" (*urai koḷ*) can be understood in three ways:
1.  It describes a beauty so overwhelming that those who long to see it can only stammer, "That! That!" their mouths dry with yearning. As the sages said of Rama’s reign: “The people’s constant talk became ‘Rama, Rama, Rama!’ The world became filled with Rama when Rama was ruling the kingdom.” (Ramayana, Yuddha Kanda 128.104 [?]).
2.  It can mean a sacred form that is beyond the reach of speech, an object that words cannot describe.
3.  It can also mean a sacred form that surpasses any standard of purity or touchstone for comparison. As another verse states: "The finest gold, tested and spoken of, cannot equal the radiance of Your sacred form." (Tiruvaymoli 3.1.2).

**[Is upon my very soul.]** Your sacred form, so exceptionally beautiful, is fixed upon my very existence. How astonishing it is that the existence of my soul has become the sustenance for a divine form that is the exclusive enjoyment of the eternal celestial beings! It is just as they say, "A starving man’s mind is fixed on rice." As for the Alvar, he is one who lives in the state described in the Upanishads, declaring, "I am the food, I am the food, I am the food!" (Taittiriya Upanishad 3.10.6 [?]).
