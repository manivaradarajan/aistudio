**Verse Translation:**

O You who hold the time-destroying Disc and the white conch in Your lovely hands!
O Narayana, who consumed and then brought forth the entire world!
Though I cry out Your names again and again, and You do not come at all,
Your lotus-like, resounding ankleted feet are a beautiful adornment for my head.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary):**

(First interpretation): He says: You united with me in a manner that even You, the omniscient and omnipotent Lord, cannot fully describe.

(Second interpretation): Even if You—adorned with divine weapons like the conch and discus, which by nature destroy the enemies of Your devotees, and distinguished by auspicious qualities like compassion, tender love, and perfect accessibility—do not unite with me in this way, You have made me such that Your very existence is my complete delight.

**ப – (12000 Commentary):**

Afterward, the Alvar expresses the love that has blossomed in him for the Lord, who is Himself a great lover. He says: "O Protector, who bears the weapons to destroy the enemies of Your devotees! Even if You do not show me Your face as I desire, the very connection to Your holy feet is the defining condition for my soul's existence."

You who hold in Your beautiful hand—which enhances their splendor—the Discus, whose very nature is to be like Time, the destroyer, to Your foes, and the white Sri Pancajanya conch, which brings a contrasting beauty. And yet, You are also the one who, when danger befell the world which You must protect, consumed it all without exception, keeping it safe in Your stomach during the great dissolution to protect it, and then brought it forth to be seen when that time passed. O Narayana, who possesses this unconditional bond! When I, who am unworthy to even rise from my place and approach You, cry out and call, repeating these natures of Yours one by one, and You still do not come, so that not a single sign of Your approach is visible, as it is said, "We perceive neither trace nor track," nevertheless, for my head—for my very being, which cannot survive without You, as affirmed in "My love for You grows ever more"—Your holy feet are a beautiful adornment and a great splendor. They are like the lotus, supremely delightful, and they wear heroic anklets that resound, revealing the fame of Your protection of devotees. The underlying meaning is: my love for Your holy feet is intrinsic to my very existence.

**ஈடு: – (36000 Commentary):**

This is the sixth verse. The Alvar says: "Even if You, who are so filled with love, do not come to me, Your very existence is what sustains me and gives me delight." He is saying, "Just as my existence is what sustains and delights You, even when I am unable to offer You any service, Your existence is what sustains me, even when You do not come."

A question arises: in the midst of describing the Lord’s loving nature, why does the Alvar suddenly speak of his own love? When two sentient beings meet, unite, and interact, the resulting bliss is experienced by both. Until now, the Alvar has been describing the Lord’s loving nature. Now, he speaks of his own love to show that the Lord’s overwhelming love has turned him into a lover as well.

*   **"O You who hold the time-destroying Disc and the white conch in Your lovely hands!"**
    This is how the Alvar cries out to Him. "O You who hold the Discus, which is death itself to Your foes, along with Sri Pancajanya, whose whiteness provides a beautiful contrast to Your dark-hued divine form! You hold them in Your beautiful hand—a hand so lovely that one ought to perform a ritual waving of lights to ward off the evil eye from it even when it is bare—as gently as if You were holding a flower!" Just as whiteness is the defining quality of Sri Pancajanya, destroying foes is the defining quality of the Discus.

*   **"who consumed and then brought forth the entire world"**
    He is not one to adorn Himself with these weapons and remain untouched while His dominion suffers; He is a friend in times of distress. During the great dissolution, He protected the worlds without exception by keeping them within His stomach. When that time passed, He released them to be seen again. This is how unconditionally He protects.

*   **"Narayana"**
    This name speaks of the inherent relationship that makes it unnecessary for Him either to seek a reward or to feel indebted, thinking, "I have protected him." No one, for instance, ever suffers mental anguish thinking, "My mother protected me in her womb; what can I possibly do for her in return?" The basis for this is the inherent relationship, and it is just the same with Him. Indeed, He is the one who, just as a mother would, kept you in His belly and granted you salvation.

*   **"again and again"**
    He calls out, speaking of:
    *   The beauty of His hands and the divine weapons they hold,
    *   His nature as a timely friend in distress,
    *   And the inherent relationship that cannot be abandoned even if these other qualities were absent.
    The repetition shows how deeply he is immersed in each of these aspects.

*   **"When I cry out and call"**
    "When I, a weak person, cry out and call on You." It means to cry with a great voice, in a way that would make Him rush from His place, even if He were in the supreme abode.

*   **"Though You do not come at all"**
    Even if there is no sign of Your coming at all. It is not like when it was said, "He is staying in Kusasthala and will take His meal in the morning," (Mahabharata, Udyoga Parva 5.89.20 [?]) indicating that someone had already set out from one place and arrived at another. There is no such prospect of Your coming. As it is said, "The cool sound of the trumpet announces His name," (Ramayana, Yuddha Kanda 116.34 [?]) but even that sound, a sign of His approach, is not heard.

*   **"are a beautiful adornment for my head"**
    They are an adornment for my head, which is in the state described in the words, "I will bear it on my head; only then will I find peace, not otherwise." (Ramayana, Sundara Kanda 38.64 [?]).

*   **"Your lotus-like"**
    He is like those who long to wear a freshly bloomed flower.

*   **"resounding ankleted feet"**
    The word *kurai* can mean either expanse, thus referring to the excellence of their enjoyability, or the sound of the ornaments, the anklets.

A final question: Why does he say, "Even if You do not come, they are an adornment"? He is saying, "It is not right for You to stay away. But even if that impossible thing were to happen, this is my state of mind." The underlying thought is: "You yourself made me this way, from the very beginning." If he were to let go of this foundational disposition, he would simply cry out, as he does elsewhere, "I have no one but You to sustain me!" (Tiruvaymoli 6.9.10).
