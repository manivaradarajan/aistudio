Here is the translation of the Tiruvaymoli verse, its gloss, and detailed commentary, following all provided guidelines.

**Verse 11**

The way to salvation is nothing else—realizing this with certainty,
Satakopan of southern Kurukur, famed for its fields of red lotuses,
composed these songs upon the sacred feet of Krishna.
Those who master these ten from his thousand truthful verses
will abide long upon this earth, reigning in splendor,
and rule even the heavens while remaining here below.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary)**

The phrase “truthful songs” signifies that just as the Lord’s affection for His devotees is unconditional, the fruits of reciting this decad are just as certain and eternal.

**ஈடு: – (36000 Commentary)**

In this concluding verse, the Alvar declares that both of Ishvara’s realms—the material and the spiritual—will be administered according to the will of those who practice this Tiruvaymoli.

**[The way to salvation is nothing else—realizing this with certainty]** – It was not as if the Alvar sang this after being able to fully describe the Lord’s quality of profound affection. Rather, he sang it having realized with absolute certainty that without meditating on this quality, there was no other means for him to sustain himself.

**[Upon the sacred, radiant feet of Krishna]** – Upon the sacred feet of Krishna, who revealed His supreme affection by descending as an avatara.

**[Of southern Kurukur, famed for its fields of red lotuses...]** – When the Alvar was sustained by meditating on the Lord's quality of affection, his entire town flourished, embodying the verse, “Trees bore fruit out of season” (Ramayana, Yuddha Kanda 4.10 [?]). This verse was composed by the Alvar who belongs to the praiseworthy city of Tirunakari in the southern direction, a city graced with fields of red lotuses.

**[These ten from his thousand truthful songs]** – This phrase, “truthful songs,” can be understood in two ways:
- It can refer to the entire Tiruvaymoli, which is inherently truthful, just as Brahma declared to Valmiki: “Not a single word of yours in this poem will be untrue” (Ramayana, Balakanda 2.35 [?]).
- Alternatively, it can refer specifically to these ten verses, which are without any falsehood regarding the Lord’s quality of affection. This quality is proven true by the fact that the Supreme Lord, who has all His desires fulfilled, lovingly came and united with an ordinary, destitute soul bound in this world, making the Alvar’s very existence His object of enjoyment.
When the thousand verses are said to be flawless, it naturally follows that this decad, too, is flawless.

**[Will abide long upon this earth, reigning in splendor]** – They will live for a very long time on this earth, surrounded by the splendor of the Sri Vaishnava community, just like Emperumanar (Ramanuja).

**[And rule even the heavens while remaining here below]** – While still living here, they will rule the supreme abode, making it operate according to their slightest written directive. This is not like reaching the supreme abode and being told, “Rule the heavens, you who are devotees of the Lord of the discus” (Tiruvaymoli 10.9.1). Instead, while still on this earth, they will find that both realms operate according to their command.

Regarding the phrase, **“abiding long upon this earth, reigning in splendor,”** Jiyar would often say with great feeling, “Unlike me, who lost him as if snatching food from my very mouth, you will have the blessing of remaining for a long time on this earth with the splendor of the Sri Vaishnava community. You will reside here with your unique spiritual distinction made manifest, having ‘severed ties with worldly folk’ (Tirumoli 2.3.2).” He would say this because he lost his master, Bhattar, when he was still very young.

**Dramidopanishad Sangati**

This is the conclusion of this decad: Though Hari is free from all desires, here He is overcome by compassion. Through Him, the entire community of devotees is fully enjoyed. The entire earth becomes endowed with His glory, and even the Supreme Master Himself and all others come under the sway of these devotees.

**Dramidopanishad Tatparyaratnavali**

The devotees are equal to the Upanishads, and indeed superior in their enlightened awakening, for the following reasons:
- The Lord’s face is heard to be the ornament of the Veda’s crown (Verse 1).
- The community of devotees has the vision granted by Him (Verse 2).
- He, in turn, is to be worshiped, for He bestows true knowledge of Himself (Verse 3).
- And His own people are deeply cherished even by the Lord of Sri (Verse 4).
- Even today, the eternal residents of the spiritual realm offer Him service (Verse 5).
- Therefore, the devotees are equal to the Upanishads themselves (Verse 6).

**Tiruvaymoli Nurrandadi**

To resolve all His own deficiencies, the Lord who is King of all approached the Alvar's unending anguish. He dispelled it completely, revealed His sacred feet, and united with him. Because Maran praised this glorious quality of His, this world has truly flourished.
