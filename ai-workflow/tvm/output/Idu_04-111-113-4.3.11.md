**Verse 11**

**Verse Translation**

Realizing there is no other path to salvation,
Satakopan of southern Kurukur—a city of fields with red lotuses—
sang of the radiant feet of Krishna.
Those who master these ten among his thousand unfailing songs
will abide on earth, reigning in splendor,
and, while still on this ground, rule the heavens too.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary)**

The phrase "unfailing song" means that the Alvar is affirming the truth of all this intimacy, wherein the Lord mingled with him out of limitless affection.

**ப – (12000 Commentary)**

In this concluding verse, the Alvar states that both of the Lord’s realms will be at the command of those who master this Tiruvaymoli.

Having meditated upon the truth that there is no means to survive other than by speaking of the Lord’s loving nature, the Alvar composed this Tiruvaymoli upon the supremely delightful feet of Krishna. For those who master this specific Tiruvaymoli—which declares, “There is not a single falsehood in this interaction where the Lord mingled with limitless affection; it is all true”—within the thousand songs of the Alvar, who is the head of the southern city of Tirunakari with its fields of red lotuses, the result is as follows: They will live long upon the earth, endowed with the full glory of a Vaishnava.

**ஈடு: – (36000 Commentary)**

In this concluding verse, the Alvar declares, “Both of the Lord’s realms will be at the command of those who master this Tiruvaymoli.”

*“Realizing there is no other path to salvation…”*
The Alvar did not speak of the Lord's loving nature because he was capable of fully comprehending and articulating it. Rather, he spoke because he realized with absolute certainty that without speaking of it, there was no other way for him to survive.

*“…upon the radiant feet of Krishna.”*
He sang upon the sacred feet of Krishna, who revealed His supreme, loving nature by incarnating in this world.

*“…of southern Kurukur—a city of fields with red lotuses…”*
When the Alvar was sustained by meditating on the Lord’s loving nature, his entire town blossomed, just as in the forest of Rama where it was said, “The trees bore fruit out of season.” This verse was composed by the Alvar of Tirunakari, a city praiseworthy in the south, graced with fields of red lotuses.

*“…among his thousand unfailing songs, these ten…”*
This phrase, “unfailing song,” can be understood in two ways:
*   It may refer to the entire Tiruvaymoli, just as Brahma told Valmiki about his Ramayana, “Not a single word in your poem shall be false.”
*   Alternatively, it may refer specifically to these ten verses, which affirm the truth of the Lord’s loving nature—a truth where Sarveshvara, the Lord whose every desire is fulfilled, so eagerly sought out and mingled with a bound soul afflicted by nescience, making the Alvar's very existence the instrument of His own delight.

When the entire work is called “the thousand without falsehood,” that same quality naturally applies to this decad as well.

*“...will abide on earth, reigning in splendor…”*
They will live for a long time on this earth, endowed with the great glory of a Vaishnava, just like Ramanuja.

*“…and, while still on this ground, rule the heavens too.”*
Even while living here, they will command the supreme realm, making it function according to their written directive. This is not like reaching the heavens and then being told, “Rule the celestial world, you servants of the Lord of the discus!” (Tiruvaymoli 10.9.1). On the contrary, they will find that the supreme realm operates according to their will, even while they remain here on earth.

Regarding the phrase, “abide on earth, reigning in splendor,” Jiyar would often say with great feeling, “Unlike us, who lost what was like food just as it was entering our mouths, they will be blessed to live for a long time on earth with the true glory of a Vaishnava, remaining distinct from worldly people, as described in the verse, ‘severing ties with those of the world.’” For he had lost his teacher, Bhattar, in his own youth.

**Drāviḍōpaniṣad Saṅgati**

When Hari, who had held him in a firm embrace, disappeared at the end, the Alvar, whose love had been aroused, recovered and, with hands folded in his heart, declared out of deep affection how the very existence of the Lord of Sri—though He is of supreme greatness and possesses full glory—depended on the Alvar’s own heart.

**Drāviḍōpaniṣad Tātparyaratnāvalī**

In this decad, the Alvar describes the Lord’s loving nature as demonstrated by His acts:
*   He made the white-turbaned, brilliant-handed Garuda His conveyance (Verse 1).
*   He resides in the cosmos He manifests solely for the sake of sustaining His devotees (Verse 2).
*   Moved by parental love for His devotees, He places His twin feet on their heads (Verse 3).
*   He enjoys the full essence of Sri and Bhumi Devi and grants that essence to others (Verse 4).
*   He is the one firm means of attainment, even among other such means (Verse 5).
*   He reveals His own essential nature to favor His devotees (Verse 6).
*   He, the loving one, is eager to taste the embrace that is dependent on the love of His beloved (Verse 7).
*   He, the knower of love’s sentiment, is eager for the experience of that loving feeling (Verse 8).
*   He is intoxicated by the sweet taste of contemplating His devotee’s words (Verse 9).
*   His essence becomes one with the heart of His beloved (Verse 10).

**Tiruvaymoli Nūṟṟantāti**

So that all the deficiencies of the Lord, the King of kings, would be removed, the Lord approached and dispelled Maran's incessant affliction of separation by revealing Himself fully and mingling with him. Because Maran, a soul of such quality, praised this act of mingling, this entire earth flourished.
