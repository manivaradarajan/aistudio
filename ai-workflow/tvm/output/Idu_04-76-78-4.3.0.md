Introduction to the Third Tiruvaymoli: Kōvaivāyāḷ

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary):** In this decad, the Alvar, his previous dejection completely dispelled by the Lord who graciously united with him, is filled with a love born from experiencing His quality of tender affection (*praṇayitva*). Out of this love, he now speaks of that very affection.

**ஒ - (9000 Commentary):** In this third Tiruvaymoli, the Lord united with the Alvar in such a way that he felt he had received everything he ever desired. Contemplating the Lord’s profound, loving affection (*praṇayitva*) for him, the Alvar was filled with wondrous joy. Overflowing with this immense love, he graciously speaks of this very quality of the Lord’s affection.

**ப – (12000 Commentary):** In this third Tiruvaymoli, the Supreme Lord united with the Alvar to end his anguish. Seeing the Alvar’s own extraordinary love, which was the very cause of his deep attachment, the Lord Himself became deeply devoted to the Alvar. Contemplating this state, the Alvar experienced the Lord’s nature of removing all obstacles that prevent one’s attainment of Him; His relationship with souls, born of His role as Protector; His essential nature as Narayana, who is the Self of all beings, and so on; His power to destroy the enemies of His devotees while protecting His followers; His union with sublime qualities like gentle condescension; His possession of the very instruments of protection; His nature of claiming a soul for His exclusive service; His all-pervasiveness; the radiant splendor of His absolute supremacy; and His immeasurable greatness. Experiencing the Supreme Lord, who possesses all these attributes, the Alvar becomes filled with delight. He graciously speaks of the Lord's tender affection (*praṇayitva*), through which the Supreme Lord so lovingly desired the Alvar’s very self and all that belonged to him, cherishing them as his own desired objects of enjoyment, like garlands, fine garments, ornaments, and fragrant sandal paste.

**இ - (24000 Commentary):** In this third Tiruvaymoli, the Lord united with the Alvar in such a way that he felt he had received everything he ever desired. Contemplating the Lord’s profound affection for him, the Alvar was filled with love, and out of this overflowing love, he speaks of this very quality of affection (*praṇayitva*). The masters explain this in three ways:
*   **Empar** would say: To the Alvar, who longed to attain experiences that were distant in time and space, the Lord revealed a particular quality. Through this, the Alvar forgot all his previous sorrows and simply experienced that one quality.
*   **Tirumalai Nampi** would say: The Supreme Lord looked upon the Alvar and assured him, “We shall do as you have requested.” Feeling as though he had already received it, the Alvar became fulfilled.
*   **Bhattar** would say: To the Alvar, who longed for experiences distant in time and space, the Lord—being the Master of Time—removed the limitations of past, present, and future, making all of it a single, unified field of experience like the present moment. Thus, feeling he had received everything, the Alvar now enjoys it. Since the Lord is all-powerful and the controller of time, there is nothing He cannot do.

Finding a soul who longed for experiences distant in time and space, the Lord revealed His quality of tender affection (*praṇayitva*), through which He holds the Alvar’s very existence as everything to Him. The Alvar, experiencing this, is filled with joy. Just as the Alvar’s affection for the Lord is expressed in the Tiruvaymoli "Pālaṉāy ēḻulaku" (2.2), so this Tiruvaymoli expresses the Lord's affection for the Alvar.

**ஈடு: – (36000 Commentary):** Because the Lord found a soul who yearned to receive and experience, right here and now, all His divine manifestations from all lands and all ages, He revealed to him His own quality of tender affection (*praṇayitva*), through which He holds the Alvar’s very existence as everything to Him. Seeing this, the Alvar too felt as though he had received everything and now enjoys that state. Just as the Alvar’s affection for the Lord is expressed in the Tiruvaymoli "Pālaṉāy ēḻulaku" (2.2), so this Tiruvaymoli expresses the Lord's affection for the Alvar.

The revered elders offer three explanations for this.
*   **Empar** would graciously say: “Like one who gives a coconut to a child crying for the moon to soothe its tears, the Lord revealed a different quality—His tender affection—and made the Alvar experience it. Immersed in this, the Alvar forgets his other longings and enjoys this experience.”
*   **Tirumalai Nampi** would explain: “If a person asks for something, and the giver nods his head in assent, promising to do it, the joy felt is not one that will later be diminished by the pain of not yet having it. In this way, when the Lord promised, ‘We shall arrange it so,’ the Alvar forgot his previous sorrow and felt he had received everything, and so he enjoys.” Indeed, when Sri Kausalya said to Perumal as he was departing for the forest, ‘I, who have but one son, cannot bear to be separated from you; I will go with you,’ He looked into her face and spoke a single word of assurance, explaining that her duty lay elsewhere. Forgetting her sorrow, she performed auspicious rites for His journey and returned. Similarly, when Krishna uttered the single phrase, “Do not grieve” (Bhagavad Gita 18.66), Arjuna was steadied and declared, “I stand firm; my delusion is gone” (Bhagavad Gita 18.73).
*   **Bhattar** would graciously say: “To this Alvar, who yearned to experience things across all three divisions of time right now, the Lord—because He wields the very wheel of time—removed the limitations imposed by time. He collapsed time into a single, unified field, making it all fit for experience just like the present moment. In this state, the Alvar now enjoys everything.”

### **Verse 4.3.1**

கோவைவாயாள்பொருட்டு ஏற்றினெருத்தமிறுத்தாய் மதிளிலங்கைக்
கோவைவீயச்சிலைகுனித்தாய் குலநல்யானைமருப்பொசித்தாய்
பூவைவீயாநீர்தூவிப் போதால்வணங்கேனேலும் நின்
பூவைவியாம்மேனிக்குப் பூசும்சாந்து என்னெஞ்சமே.

**Verse Translation:**
For the sake of the maiden with lips like ripe *kōvai* fruit, You shattered the necks of the bulls!
So the king of walled Lanka would perish, You bent Your mighty bow!
You broke the tusk of the magnificent, noble elephant!
Though I may not worship You at the proper times, scattering water with unfading blossoms,
my very heart has become the cooling sandal paste for Your body, which blooms with the dark, eternal hue of the *kāyā* flower.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary):** “For the sake of Nappinnai, you destroyed the seven demons in the form of bulls; you annihilated Ravana, the son of Pulastya; you killed the demon in the form of the Kuvalayapida elephant. Even though I have not performed the customary services at the appropriate times to soothe the fatigue from your efforts in destroying these enemies of your devotees, my mind has become a divine, cooling, and supremely fragrant unguent for Your divine body, which is as tender as a budding flower and removes all weariness. Oh, what astonishing affection (*praṇayitva*) is this!” he exclaims.

**ஒ - (9000 Commentary):** In this first verse, the Alvar says, “Though I was not able to perform the customary services that could soothe the fatigue You incurred from destroying the enemies of Your devotees, the very existence of my heart has itself become that service.”

[For the sake of the maiden… broke] Yielding to the smile of Nappinnai Piratti, and for the sake of uniting with her, You broke the mighty necks of the bulls. You graciously bent Your bow so that Ravana, the arrogant ruler of Lanka, would be destroyed. You effortlessly broke the tusk of the elephant, which was of a fine breed and endowed with all perfect features, making it formidable for anyone to even approach. [Scattering water with unfading blossoms…] Even though I was not able to perform service to you at the prescribed times with water and flowers. "With unfading blossoms" can also mean "offering flowers." [For Your body, which blooms… flower] For Your body, which has the nature of the blue-black *kāyā* flower; or, for Your body, which cannot be without the hue of the *kāyā* flower.

**ப – (12000 Commentary):** In the first verse, addressing the Supreme Lord, whose nature is to destroy the obstacles to attaining Him, the Alvar declares, “You have taken my heart as the fragrant paste for Yourself.”

You are the one who, for the sake of Nappinnai Piratti (**kōvai vāyāḷ poruṭṭu**), whose lips (**vāyāḷ**) are red like the *kōvai* fruit (**kōvai**), broke (**iṟuttāy**) the necks (**eruttam**) of the bulls (**ēṟṟiṉ**). You are the one who bent (**kuṉittāy**) the bow (**cilai**) so that Ravana, the king (**kō**) of Lanka (**ilaṅkai**) with its great walls (**matiḷ**), would perish (**vīya**). You are the one who broke (**ocittāy**) the tusk (**maruppu**) of the fine, noble (**nal**) elephant (**yāṉai**) of a superior breed (**kulam**). Even though (**ēlum**) I have not worshipped (**vaṇaṅkēṉ**) You at the proper times (**pōtāl**) by scattering (**tūvi**) water (**nīr**) with unfading (**vīyā**) blossoms (**pūvai**), for Your (**niṉ**) divine body (**mēṉikku**), which has the unfading (**vīyā**) hue of the blue-black *kāyā* flower (**pūvai**), the sandal paste (**cāntu**) to be smeared (**pūcum**) is my heart itself (**eṉ neñcamē**).
