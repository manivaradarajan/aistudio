**Verse Translation**

My very soul is the garland, and my love,
The golden, radiant crown and countless other jewels—it is that love.
The fitting garment—it is that love,
The fame the three worlds approach to praise—it is that love,
All for Krishna, my great benefactor, my Lord who wields the discus of time.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary)**

For Krishna, who possesses the divine discus whose nature is to devour His foes, the holy basil garland fit to be placed upon His divine feet, chest, and shoulders is my very soul. The innumerable and varied divine ornaments, the fitting divine yellow silk garment, the fame that all the worlds proclaim and praise—all of this and more is my love.

**ப – (12000 Commentary)**

Next, the Alvar declares that for Krishna—who is supremely enjoyable, the absolute Master, a great benefactor, and graciously accessible—his love and other qualities have become all of His ornaments and possessions.

For Him who holds the **discus** that governs **time** (`kālacakkarattāṉ`); for **my Lord** (`emmāṉ`), who, by revealing His beauty, enslaved me so that I would not fall under time's sway; for **my great benefactor** (`empirāṉ`), who enables me to experience that beauty for as long as time endures; for **Krishna** (`kaṇṇaṉ`), who incarnated accessibly according to the needs of the age;
my **soul**-substance (`enatu uyir`), which is contained within my sense of “I-ness,” is becoming the **garland** (`kaṇṇi`) borne upon His head. My **love** (`kātal`), a quality of the soul, has become the **golden** (`kanakam`), **radiant** (`cōti`) **crown and the countless other ornaments** (`muṭi mutalā eṇ il pal kalaṉkaḷum`). The **fitting** (`ēlum`) divine yellow silk **garment** (`āṭaiyum`), which indicates His supremacy over all, is **that very love** (`aḵtē`). The **fame** (`kīrttiyum`) that the **three worlds** (`mūvulakum`) of souls **approach** (`naṇṇi`) and incessantly **praise** (`naviṟṟum`) is **that very love** (`aḵtē`). The inner meaning is that the Lord considers His being the object of the Alvar’s love as both a magnificent adornment and an immense glory.

**ஈடு: – (36000 Commentary)**

In this fifth verse, the Alvar declares that each of his loving qualities has become, for the Lord, all of His ornaments and other accoutrements.

[My soul is the garland] It is this very thing that I consider ‘mine’ that He has taken as His garland. It would be fitting for Him to take as His garland the one known as “the garland upon His chest” (Sri). Leaving her aside, it is my very existence that He takes as His garland.

[My love is the golden, radiant crown and countless other jewels] My love is the desirable crown that signifies supreme sovereignty and the countless, varied divine ornaments. How can the Alvar’s love become an ornament? The answer is this: the Lord Himself considers the glory of becoming the object of the Alvar’s love to be equal to the glory that comes from wearing innumerable ornaments. The Alvar speaks from this perspective.

[And the fitting garment is that too] The divine yellow silk garment, perfectly suited to His sacred waist, is that same love. There is a story: one day, a Srivaishnava washerman brought the sacred garments to Embar, having prepared them with extraordinary beauty. Immensely pleased, Embar took him by the hand, led him into the Lord’s presence, and said, “My great Lord! Please cast Your divine eyes upon how perfectly he has prepared these garments to fit Your sacred waist!” The Lord, seeing them, was delighted. He bestowed His grace upon Embar and then declared, “For this one’s sake, We have forgiven the crime the washerman committed against Us.” [Translator’s Note: This is an allusion to the washerman in Mathura during the Krishna-avatara, who insulted Krishna and was killed for his offense.]

[And the fitting garment is that too] It is not only that his love has become many things of a single kind (like ornaments); it has now begun to become many things of different kinds as well. The divine yellow silk garment, the very emblem of the Supreme Person, is that same love. The Alvar’s love is the divine ornament and sacred garment that He has been fashioning for a very long time. For, as the Alvar says, “Even in my unknowing youth, He instilled love for servitude in me” (Tiruvaymoli 2.3.4), showing that his love is coeval with his very existence. This is supported by scripture: *“hōrajanam vāsaḥ”* (which is another reading of *mahārajanam vāsaḥ*). Since this Tiruvaymoli is a “song without falsehood,” one need not doubt its truth.

[The fame the three worlds approach to praise] The fame that not just the wise, but all beings in the three worlds approach and praise like a roaring ocean, is that same love. It is the Lord’s own thought that “After this Alvar began to love me, even those who were devoted to other ends have become exclusively devoted and now praise me.”

What follows describes how He personally cultivated this love in the Alvar. He showed the Alvar those of perfect conduct and the one with the perfect circle (the discus), to make him abound in devotion.

[For Krishna, my great benefactor, my Lord who wields the discus of time] For Krishna, my Lord, who, by showing me the beauty of His hand and discus, bestowed upon me the great gift of exclusive devotion, making me exclaim, “For those who have attained a love that consumes all time, is there any sleep for their eyes?” (Tiruviruttam 97).

[The discus of time] He can turn day into night. This refers to the discus that governs time; or, it can mean the discus that severs our bondage to time. Even in a time when people say, “They will no longer worship,” and in this world that gives birth to darkness, it is the discus of abounding grace. Just as it never leaves His hand, it ensures that one never leaves His feet. It is the discus that inspires loving taste. Standing in His hand, it makes this devotee fall at His feet.
