**Eighth Verse**

**Verse Translation**

O You who are devoted to my very soul!
O Embodiment of radiant consciousness, who stood pervading the seven beautiful worlds, becoming all things completely!
My soul has become Yours, and Your soul has become mine.
You have stood in just this way—but how could I ever find the words to describe it?

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary)**

O You who entered within all worlds as their controller! Even while being one whose every desire is already fulfilled, You have become my sole sustainer! You graciously mingled with me in such a way that my soul is now subject to Your will, and Your own divine, essential self is subject to mine. After speaking of this union, the Alvar, finding even these words insufficient, concludes that it is impossible to describe the true manner in which the Lord mingled with him.

**ப – (12000 Commentary)**

Next, the Alvar asks, "Is it possible to describe You, who for my sake pervaded all the worlds and accepted me?"

O You who are intensely focused upon my very soul-substance! O You whose essential form is self-luminous consciousness! You stand having fully pervaded the seven worlds—all of which possess inherent splendor and are pervaded by You—in such a way that all things have become modes unto You. My essential soul is now an object of Your enjoyment, and Your divine, essential self is an object of my enjoyment. You stood in this very way. What verses could I possibly compose to describe this? Thus, the mutual love of both is revealed.

**ஈடு: – (36000 Commentary)**

**Eighth Verse.** The Alvar declares that the union that has arisen between them—a union so profound that one cannot exist without the other—is beyond the realm of speech.

[**O You who are devoted to my very soul!**] This can mean one of two things:
1.  “O You who possess the supreme bliss that comes from having obtained my very existence!”
2.  “O You who possess the intense desire to obtain me!”
Alternatively, the phrase can be understood as a direct address (vocative).

[**Who stood pervading the seven beautiful worlds...**] Based on the two meanings above, this can also be interpreted in two ways:
1.  The Lord’s all-pervasiveness itself gained a new splendor from the bliss of obtaining the Alvar.
2.  The Alvar feels that the Lord became all-pervasive simply to capture him, just as someone, out of an intense desire to seize a single person, might surround an entire town.

[**The seven beautiful worlds**] This refers to the new radiance that dawned upon the world after the Lord came and mingled with the Alvar. Just as the saying goes, “Nourishment reveals itself in the body,” when the soul is fulfilled, the body also gains a new glow. Is He not, after all, the soul of the world?

[**Pervading and becoming all things completely**] This describes the way He stood, pervading everything without remainder, just as a universal quality is fully present in each of its individual instances.

[**O Embodiment of radiant consciousness!**] O You whose very essence is luminous consciousness!

[**My soul has become Yours, and Your soul has become mine**] My soul is Yours, and Your soul is mine. My essential nature is subject to Your will, and Your essential nature is subject to my will.

While the great master Alavandar was expounding on this very passage, some of the disciples who were present asked, “We can understand how this soul’s nature can be subject to His will, but what does it mean for His nature to be subject to this soul’s will?”

Alavandar graciously replied, “On the day this soul resolves, ‘I will offer myself to Him,’ Karma may very well obstruct the path. But on the day the Supreme Lord decides to make Himself subject to this soul’s will, there is no one who can prevent it. Therefore, it is that latter state that truly endures.” He then added, “In fact, the real point of doubt should be whether this soul’s nature can *ever* truly be subject to His will!”

[**You have stood in just this way**] You stood in this very manner.

[**How could I ever find the words to describe it?**] The Alvar exclaims, “Was it ever possible for me to compose verses to describe this magnificent, loving nature of Yours?”
