**Verse 4**

Intending to kill, she gave her breast to Your mouth;
You destroyed the life of that deceitful demoness,
O wondrous cowherd boy! O Vamana! O Madhava!
Though I could not worship You with cool, flowering garlands at the proper times,
the garland that adorns Your lofty crown, wreathed with cool flowers,
is my very soul.

**Ah – (6000 Commentary):**
The Alvar says: You possess the inherent nature of destroying the enemies of Your devotees, You grant the desires of those who seek refuge in You, and You are the Lord of Sri. Even though I have not worshipped You with cool, flowering garlands at the appropriate times, my very soul has become the garland that adorns Your crown, which is itself wreathed in cool, flowering garlands.

**Pa – (12000 Commentary):**
Next, the Alvar declares: You destroyed the demoness who came in a favorable guise and made me exclusively Yours. O Lord of Sri, my very life-breath has become a special garland for Your divine crown!

(To destroy her,) she who, intending to kill, placed her breast in Your divine lips; You destroyed the life of that treacherous demoness (Pūtana), who adopted the deceptive form of a mother. O wondrous One, flawless in Your childhood as a cowherd! O Vamana, who by this great deed made fruitful the Lordship You displayed in that incarnation, which makes the whole world exclusively Yours! O Madhava, who thereby secured Your inherent nature as the Lord of Sri! Though I was not able to worship You—who are the dispeller of those who appear in such favorable guises—with garlands of unique, cool flowers as was fitting for each occasion, the garland that is offered as a special adornment for Your crown, which is lofty (indicating Your supreme sovereignty), adorned with garlands made of cool, beautiful flowers, is indeed my very life-breath!

**Īṭu: – (36000 Commentary):**
**Fourth Verse.**
The Alvar says: At those moments when You vanquished Pūtana and others, I was not able to perform the service of soothing Your fatigue. Yet, for Your exquisitely delicate divine form, which cannot bear to be without such soothing service, the garland offered is my very existence!

[**Intending to kill**] The way she came, resolved to destroy, was such that some would surely have to perish. Since the verse does not specify *whom* she intended to kill, the Alvar implies: she came resolved to bring about the dissolution of the entire universe. After all, if you harm the soul, the body perishes on its own. If you strike at the life-center, you do not need to harm each limb individually—and is He not the one life for all the worlds? Did not the great king Sugriva say, upon seeing Vibhishana, “He has come to kill us, without a doubt” (Ramayana, Yuddha Kanda 17.20 [?]), feeling that an attack on Rama was an attack on them all.

[**Gave her breast to Your mouth**] The Alvar feels the act of her giving poison to the Lord’s divine lips as if she had given it to his own, which is why he says she “gave.” Alternatively, the words for “giving” and “offering” are synonyms, so it could simply mean that she offered it.

[**The deceitful demoness**] Beyond the ignorance inherent in her birth, she came full of deception. That is, she did not appear as a demoness but as a mother. As the scriptures say, “the demoness who came as a mother” (Tirumoli 1.5.6 [?]).

[**Destroyed her life**] He turned the universal destruction she had planned back upon her alone.

[**O wondrous cowherd boy!**] O cowherd boy of astonishing power! He, too, drank the milk simply as a child would; she, too, gave her breast as a mother would. She perished simply due to the inherent nature of the Lord, who is poison to the demonic host.

[**O Vamana!**] In that Krishna incarnation, if Pūtana gave her breast, there was at least a mother present to give Him her own milk as an antidote. As it is said, “When He had drunk from the venomous breast, the cowherd mother, to nurse Him back, drew near and placed her own breast in His mouth,” and, “Taking up the great Lord who had drunk the demoness’s milk, the cowherd mother nursed Him without fear.” But in this Vamana incarnation, even that comfort was absent. His mother and father, having brought Him into this world, were preoccupied with their penance, leaving Him to go all by Himself to the place where the demons resided. It is not like when enemies come to where one is; for Him to go to the very place where His adversaries were—this would cause the deepest, most burning anxiety in a devotee’s heart. This is the very anxiety that another Alvar expressed when he lamented: “O great Lord! Had You not been born with such grace, grown without splendor, and taken the name ‘Vamana,’ which suggests smallness?” (Periya Tiruvantati 16 [?]).

[**O Madhava!**] As the saying goes, “For those graced by Sri, there are no inauspicious days.” The only reason He escaped these perils is that Sri was watching over Him from her place upon His chest. Even if there were no danger at all, devotees would still feel an overwhelming need to offer benedictions for the divine couple, just seeing them together. Indeed, the most devoted souls are always chanting, “A thousand years of blessings to the Goddess who lives on Your right chest, giving You splendor” (Tiruppallantu 2).

[**With cool, flowering garlands… I could not worship**] At those very moments when Pūtana and others approached, I was not able to fall at Your divine feet and perform the service of soothing Your fatigue.

[**For Your lofty crown, wreathed with cool, flowering garlands**] For Your sovereign crown, which cannot be without cool, flowering garlands and which indicates Your supreme lordship, the garland I lovingly offer is my *prāṇan*—it has become my very existence.
