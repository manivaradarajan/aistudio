### Verse Translation

Even if I praise, and all seven worlds praise, and then He Himself also praises—
as He is praised again and again, where could it ever end?
As He sweetens like honey, milk, sugarcane candy, and nectar,
I praised my great Lord, I, only so that I might live.

If it is asked, “Did you praise Him because you are truly capable of it?” The Alvar replies: “No. Even if I, all the souls who dwell in every world, and the Lord Himself—who possesses innate omniscience and other such qualities—were to praise Him together for all time, could we even approach the shore of His limitless ocean of glory?”

If it is then asked, “Why, then, do you attempt to praise His glory, which even the Lord Himself cannot fully praise?” The Alvar answers: “I praised Him because He was so sweet.”

If it is asked further, “But would anyone attempt something impossible just because it is sweet?” He concludes: “I praised Him because I cannot sustain myself otherwise.”

Subsequently, the Alvar says: “I praised the One whose immeasurable greatness cannot be fathomed by anyone, for the very sake of my own existence.”

I—who was graced with His flawless knowledge and love—praise Him. All these worlds, without distinction between the ignorant and the all-knowing, praise Him. And even beyond that, even if He Himself—the omniscient One who is the bestower of knowledge to all—praises Himself, whose essential nature is immeasurable; as He is praised again and again without repetition, where will it ever find an end?

(Nevertheless, the reason for my praise is this:) Because He is sweet in every way, like honey, milk, sugarcane candy, and nectar, I praised my great Benefactor who made me experience Him. I praised Him for my own survival.

**Tenth Verse**

In this tenth verse, the Alvar says: “I praised this subject, who cannot be fully praised even if I, all the worlds, and the Supreme Lord Himself praise Him with a single voice, simply because of my own helplessness.”

*[**Even if I praise...**]* I, who was graced with flawless knowledge and love, praise Him.

*[**and all seven worlds praise...**]* Everyone praises Him—without distinguishing between those with special knowledge and those without, the small and the great.

*[**and then He Himself also praises...**]* And then, even He Himself praises—He who is naturally omniscient and possesses all power needed to complete any task He undertakes.

Even if everyone praises Him with a single voice like this, the part that has been praised becomes finite, while the part yet to be praised only grows vaster. Such is the nature of this subject. There is no difference between those devoted to other things and those devoted only to Him, between the finite and the infinite, in their inability to fathom this Lord.

So, why did you venture to praise Him?

*[**As He sweetens like honey...**]* I praised Him because of the sweetness of the subject, described in scripture as “the essence of all tastes,” and because He is the Benefactor who graciously shared His loving affection in a way that compelled me to plunge in and praise Him.

But as one who is so utterly helpless, should you venture into this just because He is sweet and a benefactor?

*[**I, only so that I might live.**]* Indeed, is it not only those who cannot survive without praising who praise Him? When someone declares, “The sacred offering is delicious!” does he first try to measure the capacity of his own stomach before venturing to praise and partake? When ruffians attack, does a wise person stop to deliberate before diving in? In the same way, I, who so longed to see His divine forms, which are so far removed from this age of strife, praised Him for my very survival, not to measure Him.
