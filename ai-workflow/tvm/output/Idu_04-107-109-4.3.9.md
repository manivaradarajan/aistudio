**Ninth Verse**

**Verse Translation:**
I am not able to speak of You. When will I ever reach the shore of the shoreless flood of Your glory? I am overcome by the delirium of love. O Supreme Lord without flaw! O Supreme Radiance without falsehood! As the good and noble ones roared their praise, I too praised You.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary):**
I am not capable of speaking of Him. “But what if I were to speak only of what is possible?” one might ask. The Alvar replies: Can I even approach the shore of the limitless flood of glory that is Your union with me? “Why, then, does he speak of a glory so unattainable?” one might ask. He says: O One who revealed Yourself to me as You truly are, and then, with no other motive, took Your union with me as Your very own limitless splendor! Just as the ever-vigilant celestials, filled with supreme devotion, became mad with deep longing and praised this union, I too, with the overflowing excess of my own deep longing, became mad and praised You.

**ப – (12000 Commentary):**
Next, the Alvar asks, “Can I ever finish speaking of You, who possess true supremacy and splendor?”

I am not capable (of putting into verse Your quality of loving affection for Your devotees). (Why is that?) When will I ever reach the shore of the ocean of Your fame, which is the expression of Your endless, loving affection? (The reason I began to speak at all is that) I became utterly bewildered by my love. O flawless Supreme Lord, who possesses true supremacy over all! O Supreme Radiance, who (like that supremacy) possesses a limitless splendor, for there is no falsehood (in Your union with me)! As the eternal celestials—who are by nature possessed of excellent knowledge and are supreme over all—roared (like the great, churning ocean) and praised You, I (overcome by love) also praised You. That is all.

**Ninth Verse**

One might ask, “If it is a reality you have experienced, what is the difficulty in speaking of it?” The Alvar replies, “The greatness of Your loving affection is no ground for my speech.”

[I am not able to speak] I can experience Your quality of loving affection and be completely submerged in it, but I cannot speak of it and bring my praise to a conclusion. “If you cannot speak of it all, can you not at least speak of the parts you are able to?” one might ask. The Alvar responds:

[Of the shore of Your… flood of glory, when will I ever reach?] Can I even reach the shore of the ocean of fame that arises from Your boundless loving affection? “If the subject is so difficult that you cannot even approach its shore, why did you even attempt to speak of it?” one might ask.

[I am overcome by the delirium of love] I became utterly bewildered by my love. Is it ever right to ask someone who has gone mad, “Why are you doing this?” “But why are *you* delirious about this subject? Do not even those who are mad need some basis for their delusion?” one might press. The Alvar answers, “I saw the eternal celestials, themselves mad with love, praising Him. That is why I did it.” After all, in relation to this subject, there is no difference between the eternal celestials, the Alvar, and even the Lord Himself in their ability to grasp it. Even the Lord, who is omniscient and omnipotent, would find His own nature difficult to comprehend if He set out to know it. He would suffer the same fate as the Vedas that tried to know Him, which had to turn back.

[O Supreme Lord without flaw! O Supreme Radiance without falsehood!] This can be interpreted in two ways:
*   Just as there is no flaw in Your state of being supreme over all, O Lord, there is no flaw in the radiant beauty that has appeared in Your form from Your union with me!
*   Alternatively: Just as there is no imperfection in the very reality of Your limitless quality of loving affection, there is no falsehood in Your union with me. O One in whose form the radiance that came from it is gloriously manifest!

[As the good and noble ones roared… I too praised You] I praised You only because I saw the eternal celestials, filled with supreme devotion, praising You and roaring like a churning ocean. Did I praise You because I myself am capable of it? No.

**Tenth Verse**

**Verse Translation:**
I praised Him, the seven worlds praised Him, all things praised Him, and then, even if He Himself praised Himself, as praise follows praise, where would it ever reach? He who is sweet like honey, milk, raw sugar, and nectar—I praised my Lord, that I might be saved.

**ஆ – (6000 Commentary):**
One might ask, “Were you not capable of praising Him, and so you praised Him?” The Alvar replies: Even if I, all the souls existing in all the worlds, and the Lord Himself—who is endowed with natural omniscience and other such qualities—were to stand together and praise Him for all time, could we even approach the shore of His limitless ocean of glory? “If His glory cannot be praised even by the Lord Himself, why do you praise Him?” one might ask. The Alvar answers: I praised Him simply because He was so sweet. “But would anyone begin something that cannot be finished, just because it is sweet?” He responds: I praised Him because I could not survive otherwise.

**ஒ – (12000 Commentary):**
In the tenth verse, the Alvar says: “He, who is endowed with the quality of loving affection, cannot be fully praised by me, by all the worlds, or even by Himself, the Lord of all. Yet, because of His overwhelming sweetness, I could not leave Him. I praised Him for the sake of my own salvation.”
