# What the Author Is Really Arguing

## The Core Thesis

The author is defending **moderate realism about properties** against two major threats:

1. **Reductionism** (properties are just substances under different descriptions)
2. **Bundle theory** (substances are just collections of co-occurring properties)

His position: **Properties and substances are both real, irreducibly distinct, yet essentially related.** Neither can exist without the other, but this mutual dependence doesn't collapse the distinction.

## The Strategic Situation

The author faces opponents on multiple fronts:

- **Vaiśeṣika atomists** who say substances are metaphysically prior and properties emerge from them as effects
- **Buddhist phenomenalists** who deny enduring substances entirely—only property-bundles momentarily co-occurring
- **Sāṃkhya materialists** who reduce properties to modifications of a single substance (prakṛti)
- **Monistic Vedāntins** who might use similar co-occurrence arguments to collapse all distinctions into absolute unity

He needs to hold a middle position: **real distinction without separability**.

## The Key Philosophical Moves

### 1. **Against Reduction to Substance (Anti-Vaiśeṣika)**

The Vaiśeṣika argument is essentially: "Properties change while substances persist → properties must be effects → substances must be their material cause → material causes are identical with effects → properties = substances."

His response: You've misidentified what counts as cause and effect. What actually happens in change is **substance-in-state-A becomes substance-in-state-B**. States are specifications of how the substance exists, not separate entities that need production. The whole cause-effect framework misleads here.

This is subtle: he's not denying transformation, but relocating it. Change happens to substances *as wholes*, not to detachable properties.

### 2. **Against Bundle Theory (Anti-Buddhist)**

The Buddhist argument: "Properties always co-occur in experience → if they were really distinct from each other, we'd sometimes find them apart → we never do → therefore they're not really distinct entities—just a bundle that we conceptually hypostatize as 'substance.'"

His response has two prongs:

**Empirical**: We *do* find partial separation—you can perceive shape without color (touch in darkness), color without texture (vision in light). Co-occurrence isn't actually universal.

**Logical**: "Co-occurrence" presupposes the distinctness of what co-occurs. The argument self-refutes. Moreover, co-occurrence depends on epistemic access conditions—what we can observe—not metaphysical structure.

### 3. **The Positive Account: Essential Relation**

His positive view: **Inseparability proves BOTH distinction AND connection.**

When X cannot exist without Y:
- X and Y must be distinct (you can't be inseparable from yourself—that's incoherent)
- X and Y must be connected (that's what inseparability means)
- This is not contradiction but the metaphysical structure of dependence relations

The key insight: **Dependence is a real relation between real relata.** Properties depend on substances to exist; substances cannot exist "bare" without properties. This is a brute metaphysical fact, not something that needs further reduction or explanation.

### 4. **The Epistemological Sophistication**

He recognizes that the same logical pattern generates disputes everywhere we find inseparability:

- Mind-body problem (inseparable but distinct?)
- Particular-universal problem (inseparable but distinct?)
- Self-God problem (inseparable but distinct?)
- Word-meaning problem (inseparable but distinct?)

His meta-point: **Don't let arguments about co-occurrence stampede you into denying real distinctions.** Inseparability is evidence FOR both distinction and connection, not evidence against distinction.

## Western Philosophical Parallels

This debate has *profound* parallels in Western philosophy:

### 1. **The Medieval Universals Debate**

This is almost exactly the **moderate realist position** of Aquinas and Scotus against:
- **Nominalists** (Ockham): only substances exist; properties are just names/concepts
- **Extreme realists** (early Platonists): universals exist independently
- **Bundle theorists** (some empiricists): particulars are just bundles of universals

The Indian author's position maps onto **Aquinas's "properties exist in re"**—neither independently (Platonic forms) nor as mere names (nominalism), but as real aspects of substances that cannot exist apart from them.

### 2. **The Substance-Property Debate in Locke, Berkeley, Hume**

- **Locke**: Substance is an "unknown substratum" supporting properties—close to the Vaiśeṣika view the author rejects
- **Berkeley**: "Esse est percipi"—no substance beyond property-bundles, exactly the Buddhist position
- **Hume**: Skeptical bundle theory—we never experience substance, only property-collections

The Indian author would critique all three:
- Against Locke: substance isn't some mysterious extra thing—it's the unified bearer we directly experience
- Against Berkeley/Hume: the bundle theory makes the co-occurrence of properties inexplicable and treats "co-occurrence" incoherently

### 3. **Modern Metaphysics: Tropes vs. Universals vs. Substance-Attribute**

Contemporary analytic metaphysics has exactly this debate:

- **Trope theory** (Williams, Campbell): properties are particular—this apple's redness is distinct from that apple's redness. Closer to Buddhist momentariness.
- **Immanent universals** (Armstrong): universals exist wholly present in particulars—very close to the Indian author's view
- **Bare particular theory** (Bergmann): substances are property-less substrata—like Locke, rejected by our author
- **Bundle theory** (Russell at times): objects are just bundles of compresent properties

The Indian author is essentially defending **Armstrong's immanent realism**: properties are universals (the same redness in multiple apples) but exist only as instantiated in substances, never "free-floating."

### 4. **The Dependence Relation**

Modern metaphysics distinguishes:
- **Ontological dependence**: X cannot exist without Y
- **Identity**: X = Y
- **Constitution**: X constitutes Y (clay constitutes statue)

The author's key insight is that **ontological dependence does not entail identity**. This is now called "non-symmetric essential dependence" or "rigid existential dependence" in contemporary metaphysics (Lowe, Fine).

His sophisticated point: the co-occurrence argument (Buddhist) illicitly moves from dependence to identity. This is the same error Hume makes in treating causal dependence as somehow less real than identity.

### 5. **The Inseparability Principle**

His analysis of inseparability is remarkably similar to **Kit Fine's work on essence and modality**:

Fine argues: when X essentially depends on Y, this shows:
1. X and Y are distinct
2. X's essence involves reference to Y
3. This is a sui generis metaphysical relation, not reducible to co-occurrence or modality

The Indian author: when properties are inseparable from substances:
1. They're distinct (inseparability presupposes distinction)
2. Properties' very being consists in qualifying substances
3. This is basic metaphysical structure, not further analyzable

This is the same insight about **essential dependence as primitive**.

### 6. **The State-of-Affairs Ontology**

When the author says properties are "state-specifications" (*avasthā-viśeṣa*), he's anticipating something like **state-of-affairs ontology** (Wittgenstein, Armstrong):

Reality consists not of substances + properties as separate inventories, but of **substances-in-states** or **facts** (the-apple's-being-red) as fundamental. Properties aren't separate things that attach to substances; they're ways substances are.

This avoids both:
- Treating properties as independent entities (Platonism)
- Reducing properties to nothing (nominalism)

### 7. **The Meta-Philosophical Parallel**

His recognition that the same logical structure (inseparability → disputes about identity vs. distinction) appears everywhere maps onto modern discussions of:

- **Mind-body problem**: Inseparable but distinct? (Property dualism, non-reductive physicalism)
- **Particular-universal problem**: The one-over-many problem
- **Part-whole mereology**: Parts inseparable from wholes in organic unities

Modern philosophers recognize these as **structural isomorphisms**—the same logical problem appearing in different domains. The author sees this clearly.

## Does His Argument Work?

**Strengths:**

1. **The self-refutation argument against bundle theory is powerful**: "Co-occurrence" does presuppose distinction. You can't coherently deny distinction while using concepts that require it.

2. **The state-specification view is attractive**: It avoids reifying properties as separate entities while keeping them real as ways things are.

3. **The dependence ≠ identity point is crucial**: Much confusion in metaphysics comes from conflating these.

**Potential Weaknesses:**

1. **The argument against perception-defeating-perception isn't fully convincing**: The silver/shell case might involve judgment-correction, not pure-perception-correction. This matters for his epistemology.

2. **The state-specification view needs more development**: What exactly IS a state? How does it relate to the substance? He gestures at this but doesn't fully articulate it.

3. **The inseparability principle might be too strong**: Can't we imagine substances without properties (prime matter) or properties without substances (Platonic forms), even if they don't actually exist that way? He needs to say why inconceivability proves impossibility.

## Bottom Line

This is **sophisticated moderate realist metaphysics** engaging seriously with reductionist and eliminativist opponents. The arguments would be perfectly at home in contemporary analytic metaphysics journals—and several ARE being made there by philosophers who've never read this text.

The author's key contribution: recognizing that **essential dependence is a primitive metaphysical relation** that cannot be analyzed away into either identity or mere accidental co-occurrence. This insight is independently valuable regardless of one's ultimate metaphysical commitments.
