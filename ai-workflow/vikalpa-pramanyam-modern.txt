# Analytical Assessment of the Dharma-Dharmi Argument

## Part I: What is the Author Really Arguing?

### Core Thesis and Strategic Situation

**The Thesis**: Properties and property-possessors are genuinely distinct yet inseparably co-existent entities, where properties possess an irreducible "self-and-other-differentiating capacity" (svānyanirvāhakatva) that blocks both infinite regress and collapse into bare particulars.

**Strategic Situation**: The author (a Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedāntin) faces a pincer movement:
- **Buddhist phenomenalists** argue that invariable co-cognition (sahopalaṃbhaniyama) proves identity: where you can't cognize A without B, they're non-different (like blue and blue-cognition)
- **Buddhists** leverage this to attack substance ontology: qualifier-qualified distinctions lead to either infinite regress (every qualifier needs a qualifier) or collapse into unqualified bare particulars (nirviśeṣa)
- The author must defend real property-instantiation while avoiding regress AND maintaining that body-soul, part-whole, and substance-attribute are genuinely relational structures (not identity relations)

The stakes are metaphysical but also theological: if inseparability implies identity, then "I am Brahman" means numerical identity (Advaita), not the embodiment relation (śarīra-śārīri-bhāva) the author's tradition requires.

### Key Philosophical Moves and Their Motivation

**Move 1: Distinguishing Co-cognition from Identity**
The argument grants invariable co-cognition but denies the entailment to non-difference. The asymmetry is crucial: co-cognition implies inseparability, but inseparability doesn't imply constant co-cognition (gravity exists inseparably from bodies but isn't always co-cognized). This breaks the Buddhist's key inference while maintaining that inseparability proves BOTH difference AND intimate connection.

*Why this matters*: It preserves the logical space for asymmetric dependence relations—B can depend on A for existence while A doesn't depend on B for cognition. This is metaphysically essential for God-world relations.

**Move 2: Self-and-Other-Differentiating Properties**
Properties like cowness must be:
- Self-differentiated from horseness (otherwise they can't differentiate cows from horses)
- Inseparable from individual cows
- Capable of appearing "in their own form" (svarūpatas) in cognition

This is the paper's most innovative move. Properties don't need meta-properties to differentiate them—differentiation is intrinsic to property-identity. Cowness IS "being-in-all-cows-and-no-non-cows." That's not a property cowness has; it's what cowness IS.

*Why this move*: It provides a stopping point for regress without appealing to bare particulars. The regress-stopper isn't a brute "no further explanation needed" but a reconception of what properties are—essentially relational but not relation-instantiating.

**Move 3: Two-Tiered Semantics**
The author distinguishes:
- **Ordinary usage**: Individual-tracking language ("cows and horses")
- **Technical discourse**: Abstraction-level terms ("cowness," "to-be-deposited-ness")

Crucially, technical terms don't designate different entities but analyze the structure of what ordinary terms already track. "Cowness-ness" (gotvātva) = "present in all cows, absent from non-cows" is not a second-order property but an articulation of cowness's actual structure.

*Why this move*: It deflates the regress worry at the linguistic level—we're not committed to ontology just because we can iterate linguistic operators. This anticipates contemporary deflationary strategies about abstraction.

**Move 4: Contextual Appearance**
Properties can appear:
- As qualifiers of substances (cowness in "this cow")
- As qualificands with individuals as qualifiers ("cowness exists in cows")
- In abstraction ("cowness as such")

There's no ontological difference in these contexts—just different cognitive framings of the same inseparable structure.

*Why this move*: It explains why the regress seems threatening linguistically but isn't metaphysically. We can shift perspective without multiplying entities.

### The Positive Account

**Ontology**: Reality consists of:
1. **Substances** (individual cows, pots)
2. **Properties** (cowness, blueness) existing inseparably in substances
3. **Structural properties** (being-in-all-cows) that are identical to, not instantiated by, first-order properties

**Cognition**: We can cognize:
- Individuals through their individuating properties
- Properties through their instantiation patterns
- The inseparable complex
- Never: bare unpropertied particulars

**Semantics**: 
- Most terms are "universal-primary"—they track individuals via properties
- No term designates utterly unqualified entities
- Abstract terms articulate structure, don't designate new entities

**Dependence Structure**: Properties depend asymmetrically on substances (no free-floating cowness) while substances depend on properties for differentiation (no bare particular).

This is a **moderate realism**: properties are real, irreducible, but not substances themselves. The innovation is making differentiation intrinsic to property-identity rather than requiring second-order differentiation-making properties.

## Part II: Western Philosophical Parallels

### Primary Structural Parallel: The Bradley Regress

The core logical structure is **exactly** F.H. Bradley's regress argument from *Appearance and Reality* (1893):

**Bradley's Argument**:
1. If substance S has property P, there must be a relation R relating S to P
2. R must relate to both S and P via further relations R₁, R₂...
3. Infinite regress
4. Therefore: relations (and thus properties) are unreal; reality is an undifferentiated One

**The Buddhist Version Here**:
1. If property P qualifies substance S, either P is qualified or unqualified
2. If qualified, by property P₁, which is either qualified or unqualified...
3. If we accept unqualified entities at any level, qualifier-free reality is established
4. Therefore: collapse into nirviśeṣa (bare particulars/undifferentiated reality)

**The Author's Response** parallels **Bertrand Russell's** response to Bradley in "The Principles of Mathematics" (1903) and later work, but with crucial innovations:

**Russell's Move**: Relations don't need relating—they're not entities that require further relations to do their work. "A has property B" doesn't require a third entity relating A and B.

**This Author's Move**: Properties don't need differentiation-makers—differentiation is intrinsic to being the property they are. Cowness doesn't need "cowness-ness" as an additional property; being-present-in-cows-and-absent-from-non-cows IS what cowness is.

### Mapping to Western Positions

**Position 1: Buddhist Phenomenalist** → **British Empiricist Bundle Theory/Phenomenalism**
- Hume's bundle theory: objects are collections of co-instantiated qualities
- No substance "underneath" properties
- Causation/co-occurrence as the only glue
- The sahopalaṃbhaniyama principle maps directly to Hume's "constant conjunction"

**Position 2: Nirviśeṣa (Bare Particular) Buddhist** → **Gustav Bergmann, Herbert Hochberg**
- Reality is bare particulars + universals requiring "exemplification" relation
- But exemplification needs exemplification (regress!)
- Solution: accept bare particulars as ultimate (parallels accepting nirviśeṣa)

**Position 3: This Author's Position** → **Moderate Realism (Armstrong-Style) with Structuralist Innovation**

Closest to **D.M. Armstrong's** immanent realism (*Universals and Scientific Realism*, 1978), but with a crucial innovation:

**Armstrong**: 
- Universals exist in their instances
- States of affairs (a's being F) are ontologically primitive—no regress because instantiation isn't a relation
- Properties are "ways things are" not additional things

**This Author**: 
- Properties exist inseparably in instances ✓
- But properties have **intrinsic identity conditions** specified by their extension-pattern
- Cowness IS "the property instantiated by all and only cows"—this is constitutive, not accidental
- This makes it closer to **structural realism** avant la lettre

### Where This Fits in Contemporary Analytic Philosophy

**1. Metaphysics of Properties**

This argument engages directly with:

**The Regress Problem** (contemporary version):
- **David Lewis**: Argues instantiation is a "pseudo-relation"—properties just ARE instantiated, no further relation needed
- **This author's version is stronger**: Properties are CONSTITUTED by their instantiation pattern, not merely instantiated without further relation

**Trope Theory Connections**:
- The "self-and-other-differentiating" capacity parallels **trope theory** (Williams, Campbell)
- Tropes are particularized properties that are self-individuating
- But this author maintains universals (cowness in all cows) not tropes
- Innovation: universals with intrinsic identity conditions specified by their actual distribution

**2. Philosophy of Language**

**The Abstraction Problem**:
- "Cowness" "cow-ness-ness" iteration parallels **Frege's concept-horse problem**
- Frege: "The concept horse is not a concept" because concepts are predicative, but speaking of them nominalizes them
- This author's solution: Iteration doesn't create new entities, just articulates structure of original entity
- Similar to **deflationary nominalism** (Hofweber, Thomasson): abstract terms don't refer to special abstract objects

**3. Formal Ontology**

The two-tiered semantics (ordinary vs. technical discourse) anticipates:

**Carnap's Internal/External Distinction**:
- Internal: questions within a linguistic framework ("Are there cows?")
- External: questions about the framework itself ("Does cowness exist?")
- This author: Technical terms analyze structure already implicit in ordinary usage
- Different from Carnap: Not anti-metaphysical—claims technical analysis reveals real structure

**4. Contemporary Structuralism**

The most underappreciated parallel: **Structural Realism** in philosophy of science

**Structural Realism** (Worrall, Ladyman, Ross):
- Objects are defined by their structural relations
- No "bare" objects underlying structure
- Structure is ontologically primitive

**This Author's View**:
- Properties are defined by their relational structure (instantiation pattern)
- No "bare" properties needing external relations to do their work
- The instantiation-structure IS the property's identity

This is **ante rem structural realism about properties**: The structure (being-in-cows-not-in-non-cows) doesn't supervene on property-identity; it CONSTITUTES property-identity.

### Conceptual Innovations Paralleling Modern Developments

**Innovation 1: Intrinsic Relation-Like Properties**

Modern parallel: **Kit Fine's** work on essence (*Essence and Modality*, 1994):
- Some properties are essentially relational
- Being Socrates' singleton set is intrinsic to {Socrates}—not an external relation
- This author: Being-instantiated-by-cows is intrinsic to cowness

**Innovation 2: Grounding Without Regress**

Modern parallel: **Grounding theory** (Fine, Schaffer, Rosen):
- Asymmetric ontological dependence
- Properties are grounded in instances, but also ground the differentiation of instances
- This author explicitly articulates this: Properties "depend asymmetrically on substances while substances depend on properties for differentiation"
- Avoids regress by making dependence relations contextual (different dependency relations, not circular)

**Innovation 3: Deflationary Abstraction**

Modern parallel: **Neo-Fregeanism** (Hale & Wright):
- Abstraction principles don't commit to new entities
- "The direction of line a = the direction of line b iff a is parallel to b"
- Direction-talk is legitimate without directions being robust entities
- This author: "Cowness-ness" talk articulates cowness's structure without new entity

**Innovation 4: Cognitive Pluralism about Properties**

Modern parallel: **Perspectival realism** (Massimi, Giere):
- Same reality appears differently from different cognitive perspectives
- No single privileged description
- This author: Properties appear as qualifiers, qualificands, or abstractions depending on cognitive context—all perspectives on one reality

---

## Part III: Critical Assessment

### Does the Argument Work?

**Strengths:**

**1. The Self-Differentiation Move Genuinely Blocks Regress**

The argument succeeds in its primary aim. If cowness IS "being-in-cows-not-in-non-cows" (constitutively, not accidentally), then:
- Cowness differentiates itself from horseness by being cowness (which includes the structural specification)
- No infinite regress because no second-order property is needed
- No collapse into bare particulars because properties retain their differentiating power

This is philosophically sophisticated—it's not merely asserting "the regress stops here" but reconceiving what properties ARE such that the regress never gets started.

**2. The Asymmetry Thesis Is Compelling**

"Co-cognition implies inseparability, but inseparability doesn't imply universal co-cognition"—this is both logically valid and metaphysically important.

Counter-example (gravity) is effective: Gravity is inseparable from massive bodies but not always co-cognized with them. Therefore invariable co-cognition is a sufficient but not necessary condition for inseparability. The Buddhist inference fails.

**3. The Linguistic Analysis Is Penetrating**

Distinguishing "ordinary usage" from "technical discourse" and arguing that iteration at the linguistic level doesn't commit to iteration at the ontological level—this anticipates by centuries the deflationary moves in contemporary metaphysics.

The observation that ordinary languages have no purely universal-designating terms ("cowness" absent from Sanskrit vernacular) is empirically astute and philosophically significant—it suggests our basic ontological commitments are to individuals-with-properties, not to properties as independent existents.

### Weaknesses and Underdeveloped Areas

**Weakness 1: The Constitutive Identity Claim Needs More Work**

The move "cowness IS being-in-cows-not-in-non-cows" is stated rather than argued for. Why should we accept that properties are constitutively defined by their extensions?

**Challenge**: This seems to conflate property-identity with property-individuation. Even if we individuate cowness by its extension, why think that's constitutive of what cowness IS?

**Parallel problem in contemporary metaphysics**: 
- Lewis's problem of "natural properties"—not all co-extensional predicates pick out genuine properties
- This author needs an account of what makes cowness a REAL property vs. gerrymandered properties like "being either a cow or the Eiffel Tower"

**Missing element**: An account of property-naturalness or sparseness that explains why some instantiation-patterns constitute real properties while others don't.

**Weakness 2: The Cognitive Pluralism Seems Under-Constrained**

If properties can appear as qualifiers, qualificands, or abstractions depending on cognitive context, what constrains these appearances? The author says "there's no rule that reality must appear exactly as articulated," but this risks making the ontology too plastic.

**Challenge**: If the same structure can appear radically differently in different cognitive contexts, what ensures we're tracking a unified reality rather than constructing different objects?

**Contemporary parallel**: Same worry about perspectival realism—if perspectives proliferate without constraint, we lose objectivity.

**What's needed**: An account of what unifies different cognitive presentations as presentations of the SAME property. The author gestures at "inseparable existence" but doesn't develop this into a theory of cross-contextual identity.

**Weakness 3: The Metaphysics of Inseparability Remains Opaque**

"Inseparable existence" (apṛthaksiddhi) does enormous work in this argument, but its metaphysics is underdeveloped. The author asserts:
- Properties exist inseparably in substances
- This inseparability grounds both difference (they're two entities) and intimate connection
- It explains why co-cognition occurs without implying identity

But HOW does inseparability work? Contemporary options:
- **Supervenience**: Properties supervene on substances? But that's asymmetric—properties seem to require substances but not vice versa for this author
- **Grounding**: Properties are grounded in substances? But substances depend on properties for differentiation—seems circular
- **Constitution**: Properties constitute substance-kinds? Closer, but needs articulation

**What's needed**: A developed theory of the inseparability relation itself. The author is defending a non-identity relation against identity-theorists, but the positive account of the relation remains programmatic.

**Weakness 4: The Body-Soul Application Is Asserted Not Argued**

The theological payoff—defending body-soul as śarīra-śārīri-bhāva (embodiment relation) rather than identity—is asserted but not argued from the property-possessor structure.

The author claims: "I am Brahman" makes sense as coordinate predication (like "I am human") if soul-Brahman are related as body-embodied, not as identical.

**Challenge**: Why is the property-substance relation relevantly analogous to the body-soul relation? Bodies aren't properties of souls in any obvious sense. The author needs to either:
- Show body-soul exemplifies property-substance structure, OR
- Show the arguments against regress apply to embodiment relations independently

This application feels tacked on rather than emerging organically from the metaphysics.

### Lasting Philosophical Contributions

**Contribution 1: Intrinsic Differentiation Without Regress**

Regardless of whether you accept the full theory, the move "differentiation can be intrinsic to property-identity rather than requiring second-order properties" is a permanent contribution to the regress debate.

**Impact**: This strategy is independently available whenever regress threatens:
- Relations don't need relating (Russell)
- Grounding doesn't need grounding (Fine)
- Instantiation doesn't need instantiating (Armstrong)
- Differentiation doesn't need differentiating (this author)

The general form: **Functional properties can be intrinsic to entity-identity rather than requiring additional entities to perform those functions.**

**Contribution 2: The Asymmetry of Cognitive and Ontological Dependence**

The distinction between "inseparability implies co-cognition" and "co-cognition implies inseparability" has lasting importance.

**Application**: Whenever phenomenalists or phenomenologists argue from cognitive inseparability to ontological identity, this asymmetry provides a response. Hume, Mach, Carnap, Quine's empiricist arguments all deploy variants of the co-cognition inference. This argument provides the logical structure for resistance.

**Contribution 3: Levels-of-Discourse Metaphysics**

The two-tiered semantics (ordinary vs. technical discourse) with the claim that technical terms analyze rather than multiply entities—this is a lasting methodological contribution.

**Impact**: It provides a middle path between:
- **Quinean desert landscapes**: Only quantifying over what's indispensable to science
- **Meinongian jungles**: Accepting entities for every grammatically well-formed term

The strategy: Accept abstract/technical vocabulary while denying it commits to new entities beyond what ordinary discourse already implies. This is methodologically sophisticated and applicable to contemporary debates about abstract objects, mathematical entities, and social ontology.

**Contribution 4: Structure-First Property Theory**

The view that properties are constituted by their instantiation-structure (being-in-cows-not-in-non-cows) anticipates structural realism by many centuries.

**Impact**: If properties are individuated by structural location rather than by intrinsic quiddities, this:
- Solves the problem of identifying properties across possible worlds (structure is the identity criterion)
- Explains why properties are scientifically tractable (science tracks structure)
- Avoids both Platonist and nominalist extremes

This could be developed into a full structuralist theory of properties where cowness is the COW-ROLE in the structure of biological kinds—anticipating exactly how contemporary structural realists treat "electron" as the ELECTRON-ROLE in quantum field theory.

## Conclusion: Philosophical Significance

This argument is a **first-rate contribution to the metaphysics of properties**—not merely of historical interest but containing moves that remain dialectically powerful against contemporary positions.

**The core insight**—that functional/relational features can be constitutive of entity-identity rather than requiring additional entities to ground those features—is a strategy of permanent value in metaphysics.

**The weakness**—underdevelopment of what "inseparable existence" metaphysically consists in—is precisely where contemporary grounding theory, structural realism, and Kit Fine's work on essence could productively engage this tradition.

**The methodological contribution**—showing how to be a robust realist about properties while maintaining parsimony about ontological commitment through careful attention to levels of discourse—deserves serious attention in contemporary metametaphysics.
