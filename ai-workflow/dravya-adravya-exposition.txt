# On the Fundamental Classification of Reality: Why We Must Distinguish Substance from What Depends Upon It

Some critics object: What is this division into "substance" (*dravya*) and "non-substance" (*adravya*)? By this logic, one could also classify everything as "pot" and "non-pot"—such a division accomplishes nothing and is philosophically vacuous.

To those who raise this objection, I say: You speak without understanding the intellectual crisis that occurred a thousand years before your time. The philosophical framework we defend was not newly invented. Rather, it was deliberately re-established, planted as firmly as driving a post deep into the ground, to recover an ancient understanding that had been nearly obliterated.

## The Historical Crisis

Consider what happened. Buddhist philosophers, with their exclusively rationalistic methods, and their followers who taught absolute non-difference, had systematically dismantled the entire tradition. As the verse describes it: "Vyāsa was made an object of ridicule, Parāśara's teachings dismissed as senseless, Śuka's words thrown out as mere play, and Bādarāyaṇa needlessly obstructed." They rendered meaningless all those scriptures—the Vedas, *smṛtis*, epics, and Purāṇas—that cultivate devotion to the Supreme.

Even the *Brahmasūtra*, which was composed specifically to establish that ultimate reality possesses intrinsic distinctions and qualities (*saviśeṣa*), was reinterpreted as teaching an undifferentiated, featureless absolute (*nirviśeṣa*).

The consequences were devastating. The Supreme Being's qualities, embodied form, and manifest glories (*guṇa-vigraha-vibhūti*) were all denied. Because ultimate reality was declared attributeless (*nirguṇa*), all praise became meaningless—what could one praise in something with no qualities? Because it was declared formless (*nirākāra*), meditation, ritual worship, and prostration became impossible—how does one meditate on or worship the formless? Because it was declared absolutely non-differentiated (*nirviśeṣa*), the Lord's compassion and tender care (*dayā-vātsalya*) were eliminated entirely.

When the world thus lost its way, disoriented and unable to find the path, it became necessary to firmly establish the doctrine of qualified reality (*suviśeṣavāda*) in direct opposition to the doctrine of the unqualified (*nirviśeṣavāda*).

This is the context in which the great commentaries on the *Brahmasūtra* were composed—specifically to re-establish qualified non-dualism.

## The Continuing Problem

But even after qualified non-dualism was firmly established, immediately afterward came an exclusively rationalistic critic who, his mind steeped in Buddhist assumptions, unable to distinguish between authoritative revealed scriptures and Buddhist texts, ignorant of the crucial difference between ordinary knowledge (*jñāna*) and the special consciousness that directly apprehends reality (*vijñāna*), reduced everything to ashes through his polemics. When even the Vedic path itself became emptied of meaning, what good could mere study of commentaries accomplish?

Therefore, if people are to develop conviction-based faith (*śraddhā*) in three things—the Lord's auspicious qualities like compassion and tenderness, the practices of meditation, worship, and prostration, and the Lord's divine embodied form (*divya-maṅgala-mūrti*)—then they must first accept that ultimate reality (*Brahman*) is not featureless but qualified (*saguṇa*). The qualifications of ultimate reality are precisely its attributes, form, and manifest glories.

Look at what follows from this: When ultimate reality possesses attributes (*saguṇatva*), all praises become meaningful—there is something real to praise. When it possesses a divine embodied form (*divya-maṅgala-vigraha*), meditation, worship, prostration, and similar practices find their proper place—there is something one can actually meditate upon and worship. When one becomes acquainted with the various manifestations of the Lord's power (*bhagavad-vaibhava*), devotional practice (*bhakti-yoga*) is nourished, exactly as stated: "One who truly knows this glory and power of mine becomes united with me through unshakable devotion—of this there is no doubt" (Gītā 10.7). 

Without these three elements—divine qualities, divine form, and divine manifestations—how could human beings possibly engage in any spiritual practice?

Therefore, conviction in the doctrine that ultimate reality is qualified must be established first. With this goal in mind, the fundamental classification was made to demonstrate that "reality is twofold: substance (*dravya*) and what depends on substance (*dravya-āśrita*)."

## Why This Classification Matters

But what benefit comes from dividing things this way?

One might ask: Why not simply divide reality into "substance and quality"? The answer is that the term "quality" (*guṇa*) has become a technical term among scholars, and some philosophers even deny any real distinction between a quality and what possesses it (*guṇa-guṇi-abheda*). Therefore, to comprehensively include everything that stands in complete opposition to substance, this broader division was presented.

Here's what's crucial: the term "non-substance" (*adravya*) should not be understood merely as a negation, as if it meant "the absence of substance." Rather, it points to something ontologically positive but fundamentally different in kind from substance. The meaning is: reality is twofold—substance and what depends upon substance for its existence. Through this classification, numerous philosophical problems in numerous contexts find their resolution, as will be demonstrated in the relevant sections.

Therefore, this division should be understood as marking out the territory of qualified non-dualism (*saguṇa-advaitavāda*)—it is far from uninformative.

## A Crucial Technical Point

One point requires clarification: in this philosophical system, the terms "self-directed" (*pratyak*) and "other-directed" (*parāk*) have specific meanings. In other doctrines, the individual self (*jīva*) and the Supreme Self (*Īśvara*) are held to be identical. But in our system, we accept as true both the distinction between individual souls and the Lord, and the mutual distinction among individual souls themselves.

This has an important consequence: all selves are "self-directed" (*pratyak*) from their own first-person perspective. But from another's perspective—since we actually use second- and third-person terms like "you" and "he/she"—a self can also be "other-directed" (*parāk*).

This means that what "I" refers to is not some mixture of the sentient and non-sentient. This will be examined in detail later (in verse 7 on the soul). The key point: "other-directedness" (*parāktva*) is not synonymous with non-sentience (*jaḍatva*).

What then is non-sentience? It means not being self-luminous, not being manifest by its own nature. But how could this ever apply to the self-luminous soul (*ātman*), even from another's perspective? It cannot.

Therefore: Non-sentience means being manifest only through something else. Sentience means being manifest by itself. "Self-directedness" (*pratyaktva*) means being manifest to oneself by oneself. "Other-directedness" (*parāktva*) means being manifest by oneself to another—not being made manifest through another. Alternatively, the word *parāk* when used as a synonym for non-sentient (*jaḍa*) is one distinct usage; the word *parāk* as applicable to sentient beings is an entirely different usage. More on this distinction in the section on souls (verse 7).

## Defining Substance: What Has States

Among these enumerated realities, we now need definitions. Among the realities enumerated, substance (*dravya*) is defined as "that which has states" (*daśāvat*).

What is a state (*daśā*)? A state is a condition—more precisely, an adventitious, inseparable attribute. Consider the example "the ground has a pot on it." The pot and similar objects are adventitious attributes of the ground. In this sense, the pot could be called a state of the ground. But notice: the pot itself is a substance—something that *has* states—not itself a state. This is the definition of what a state *is*, not of what *possesses* states.

To exclude cases like the pot, we add the qualification "inseparable" (*apṛthaksiddha*). The pot is not an inseparable attribute of the ground; it can be separated from the ground. It is therefore a separable attribute (*pṛthaksiddha-dharma*). Thus the pot is excluded from being a state of the ground.

But if we didn't include "adventitious" (*āgantuka*) in our definition, we would face over-extension. The eternality of the soul is an inseparable attribute, so without "adventitious" we would incorrectly classify it as a state. Therefore we add "adventitious." The soul's eternality is inherent (*sahaja*), not adventitious, and is thus properly excluded.

Now consider: Clay possesses adventitious, inseparable attributes like pot-ness. Because it possesses such attributes, clay and similar things qualify as substance. 

Primal matter (*prakṛti*) transforms into the form of intellect (*mahat*) and other evolutes; thus intellect-ness and similar attributes are adventitious and inseparable to primal matter. Because it possesses such attributes, the definition properly applies to primal matter. 

Similarly, time (*kāla*) transforms into the forms of moments, days, and so forth, taking on attributes like momentariness. The eternal realm (*nitya-vibhūti*) transforms into the forms of fields, pleasure-groves, and so forth. And consciousness (*dharma-bhūta-jñāna*) transforms into the forms of pleasure and other experiential modes—thus the definition applies to these as well.

But what about individual souls (*jīva*) and the Supreme Self (*paramātman*)? Though their essential nature never transforms, they take on adventitious, inseparable conjunctions with pots and other objects. Through possessing such conjunctions, the definition applies to them.

Wait—shouldn't we exclude conjunction with pots for the omnipresent Supreme Self? If we allow the definition to apply to individual souls because of their limited presence, how can we claim souls have conjunction with pots when souls are atomic in size? No problem: we can establish that the definition applies through their conjunction with air and similar pervasive things. 

Thus the substantiality (*dravyatva*) of all six substances should be understood.
