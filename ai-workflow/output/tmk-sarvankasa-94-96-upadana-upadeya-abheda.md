### Exposition of Tattvamuktākalāpa, Jaḍadravyasaraḥ, Verse 22

This passage offers a commentary on Verse 22 of Vedanta Desika’s *Tattvamuktākalāpa*, which presents the primary evidence for the fundamental identity of a material cause (*upādāna*) and its effect (*upādeya*). The commentary begins by summarizing the preceding argument against the Vaiśeṣika school’s view that an effect, or composite whole (*avayavin*), is an entirely new entity separate from its constituent parts (*avayava*).

The commentator argues that a distinct composite whole is an unnecessary hypothesis. What we call a "cloth" (*paṭa*) is nothing other than the threads (*tantu*) themselves, arranged in a specific state (*avasthā-viśeṣa*) characterized by a unique conjunction (*vilakṣaṇa-saṃyoga*) of warp and woof. This special conjunction, which the Vaiśeṣikas themselves identify as the "non-inherent cause" (*asamavāyikāraṇa*), is sufficient to explain the emergence of the effect. There is no need to posit an additional entity called "cloth" that inheres in the threads.

To support this, the commentator points to examples where even opponents do not posit a separate whole: a council (*pariṣad*) is just a specific gathering of people, a heap (*rāśi*) is a collection of grains, a forest (*vanyā*) is a multitude of trees, and a garland (*mālā*) is simply flowers arranged in a particular way. If these are understood as parts in a specific configuration, why should a pot or a cloth be treated any differently?

This view also neatly resolves the potential objection that if the effect is merely the cause, then the causal operation (e.g., the potter’s or weaver’s effort) becomes futile (*kārakavyāpāra-vaiyarthyam*). The causal operation is not futile because its purpose is to generate the specific conjunction or state that did not exist previously. The difference between the cause-state and the effect-state is precisely the presence of this new configuration. Thus, the effect is not merely the sum of its material causes; it is the material causes qualified by the new state brought about by the causal operation. This accounts for the effect’s novelty (*apūrvatvam*) without positing a new substance.

At this point, the commentator anticipates a sophisticated objection. If the "new state" or "unique conjunction" did not exist before, does this not amount to accepting *asatkāryavāda*—the doctrine that the effect is non-existent before its production? To reply that the underlying *substance* (*dravya*) always existed (thus preserving *satkāryavāda*) is to miss the point; it is like, in the words of the proverb, "being asked about mangoes and speaking of kovidara trees" (*āmrān pṛṣṭaḥ kovidārānācaṣṭe*). If one claims *satkāryavāda* with respect to the substance, must one not also concede *asatkāryavāda* with respect to the state?

The commentator’s resolution is nuanced. He asserts that since the state (*avasthā*) is invariably dependent on the substance (*dravya*), the substance has primacy, and so the doctrine is rightly called *satkāryavāda*. However, he concedes a crucial point: "It is true that the substance, *in the specific form qualified by the effect-state*, was indeed non-existent before." This leads to the clarification of his school's position: "This is why we have stated repeatedly that we are neither proponents of the Sāṃkhya view of *satkāryavāda* (where the effect pre-exists in a fully real but unmanifest form) nor of the Vaiśeṣika view of *asatkāryavāda* (where the effect is a completely new creation), but are proponents of a middle path of transformation (*madhyastha-pariṇāmavādinaḥ*)."

With this groundwork laid, the commentary turns to Verse 22 itself, which provides the positive proof for this position.

> **Verse 22: Recognitive cognition reveals the identity of the substance, since—even when dimensions differ—no other entity is perceived. For this reason, the single gross object, like a heap, is also capable of accommodating the addition or subtraction of its parts.**

#### The Argument from Recognition (*Pratyabhijñā*)

The first half of the verse argues that our experience of recognition (*pratyabhijñā*) establishes the identity of the substance through its transformations. When a piece of gold is flattened into a leaf or fashioned into an earring, its dimensions (*parimāṇa*)—the space it occupies—change. Yet, everyone has the immediate and undeniable cognition, "This is that same gold." This universal experience demonstrates that there is no absolute difference between the cause (the lump of gold) and the effect (the earring). We do not perceive the gold *and* a separate entity called "earring." We perceive gold in the state of being an earring.

Therefore, the terms "cause" (*upādāna*) and "effect" (*upādeya*) refer not to two different substances but to a single substance in two different states (*avasthā*). In the case of a pot (*ghaṭa*) and a lump of clay (*mṛtpiṇḍa*), the "cause" is clay qualified by the state of being a lump, while the "effect" is that very same clay qualified by the state of being a pot. There is nothing more than a change of state, not a change of substance.

#### A Major Objection: The Problem of Purity and Transformation

The commentator now raises a powerful objection to this doctrine of substantive identity. If crops are nourished with impure substances like manure (*grāmasāra*), and the resulting rice grains are understood to be a transformation (*pariṇāma*) of that manure, then the cause and effect are one. Does this not imply that for a pious person to eat that rice would be tantamount to consuming an impure substance, thus incurring sin and requiring expiation (*prāyaścitta*)? Merely stating that this school's view is not one of "absolute identity" is not a sufficient answer. This problem seems to push one toward *asatkāryavāda*, which would align better with the prescriptions of religious law (*dharmaśāstra*) by positing a complete break between the impure cause and the pure effect.

The commentator rejects this conclusion. Simply changing the name of a theory cannot negate the observable, scientific fact of transformation. The solution lies not in denying the transformation, but in understanding its nature more deeply. He introduces a critical distinction between two types of transformation.

1.  ***Pariṇāma* (Direct Transformation):** The transformation of clay into a pot is a case of direct *pariṇāma*. It is directly perceived, and the recognition, "This pot is clay" (*mṛdayaṃ ghaṭaḥ*), is a universal and immediate experience.

2.  ***Vivarta* (Indirect or Radical Transformation):** The transformation of manure into crops, flowers, and fruits is of a completely different order. A plant absorbs nutrients and, through the agency of the life-principle (*jīva*) within it, transforms them in a wondrous, almost magical way (*indrajāla*), producing novel colors, scents, and tastes. While it is a scientific fact that the fruit is a product of the nutrients, this transformation **does not** generate a direct recognitive cognition of identity (*dravyaikya-pratyabhijñā*). No one perceives a mango and thinks, "This is that same manure."

This second, extraordinary type of transformation, where the effect's form is so radically different from its cause that their identity is not directly perceived, is what the commentator, in a unique re-interpretation, calls *vivarta*. It is not an illusion (as in Advaita Vedanta), but a real transformation whose causal connection is knowable only through scientific reasoning (*vijñāna*) or scripture, not direct recognition. He further argues that the life-principle in the plant, being conscious, actively purifies the constituent materials during this transformation, just as the river Ganges purifies the sullied waters that flow into it.

Therefore, the question of expiation for eating the crops does not arise, precisely because the recognitive link to the impure source is severed by the nature of this radical transformation (*vivarta*). The commentator offers a grander analogy: the universe is a transformation of Brahman, but its divine nature is not perceived by ordinary senses (*carmacakṣuṣkaiḥ*). Only the wise, through knowledge (*jñāna*), recognize "All this is indeed Brahman" (*sarvaṃ khalvidaṃ brahma*). This cosmic transformation is the ultimate example of *vivarta*.

This distinction is further supported by scriptural and empirical examples. Scripture teaches that "from fire comes water" (*agnerāpaḥ*), a transformation where the qualities of the cause (heat, light) are not found in the effect, defying simple mechanical transference. Likewise, a mother's blood is transformed into nourishing milk—if they were identical, drinking milk would be the sin of drinking blood. These cases show that nature is replete with radical transformations where the effect is a purified and functionally distinct reality.

The core principle is thus:
- Where the cause is directly recognized in the effect, the transformation is **pariṇāma**.
- Where the cause is not recognized in the effect and their identity is known only through inference or scripture, the transformation is **vivarta**.

#### The Argument from Parsimony (*Lāghava*)

The second half of the verse provides another reason for rejecting a separate composite whole: it is more philosophically parsimonious. By viewing a gross object as a collection of parts in a specific state, we can easily account for the addition or removal of parts. Like a heap of grain (*rāśivat*), an object can have parts added or subtracted, becoming larger or smaller, while remaining the *same* object.

This stands in stark contrast to the Vaiśeṣika view. For them, since the composite whole (*avayavin*) is a distinct entity, the removal or addition of even a single part (*aṃśa*, or atom) would destroy the original whole and create an entirely new one. This leads to a cumbersome and counter-intuitive multiplication of entities. The model proposed here, where the object is identical to its parts-in-configuration, offers a far simpler and more elegant explanation of everyday phenomena.
