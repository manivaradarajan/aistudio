### **Exposition of the Argument for the Self's Distinction from the Body**

**(Verse 2)**

> For one with a superficial view (carmadṛṣṭi), the notion “I am this” might seem to apply to the body itself, which is merely inhabited by the self (ātmajuṣṭe). This is like the perception of fire in a red-hot iron ball, an idea rooted in the non-apprehension of the distinction (bhedakākhyātimūlā) between them. And through postulation based on scripture (śrutyarthāpatti), as well as through the scriptures (śruti) themselves—which are free from all defects—for us, the embodied one (dehī) is decisively known here as being capable of attaining other bodies (dehāntarāptikṣama), and is intrinsically of the nature of consciousness and bliss (saṃvidānandarūpaḥ).

**(Commentary)**

An objection might be raised: The direct experience “I am this” seems to firmly identify the self with the body. The counter-claim that a statement like “my self” (*mamātmā*) proves a distinction is weak, as you yourself would have to concede that this is merely a figurative expression. The verse beginning *syādvā'sau* (“For one with a superficial view...”) is offered in response to this challenge.

Let us unpack the verse. The idea that "I am this" refers to the body—a body that is merely conjoined with the self (*ātmajuṣṭe*)—is a notion that might arise (*syādvā*) for someone of a crude intellect (*carmadṛṣṭeḥ*, literally "one who sees only the skin"). This experience is founded on an error, specifically, a failure to apprehend the distinguishing factor between the self and the body (*bhedakākhyātimūlā*). The analogy given is the perception of fire (*hutavahamativat*) in a thoroughly heated iron ball (*niṣṭapte lohapiṇḍe*).

The use of *vā* (“might”) is a form of confident assertion (*prauḍhivāda*). The implication is that just as scripture says of the ultimate reality, "the fleshy eye does not see It," it is similarly impossible for those who are not true knowers—those who possess only physical eyes (*carmacakṣu*)—to perceive their own true self.

Furthermore, when the verse says "in the body alone" (*deha eva*), the word "alone" (*eva*) serves to exclude the possibility of the "I"-notion *not* applying to the body (a function known as *ayogavyavaccheda*), rather than excluding its application to anything else (*anyayogavyavaccheda*). This is because we also have experiences like “I see” and “I hear,” where the "I"-notion is clearly associated with the sense organs and other faculties.

In truth, for us who follow the Vedic tradition, the existence of a distinct self is established by the Veda itself. The verse states this with the phrase "through postulation based on scripture and through the scriptures themselves" (*śrutyarthāpattibhiśca śrutibhirapi ca*).

First, let's consider postulation based on scripture (*śrutārthāpatti*). This refers to necessary conclusions derived from scriptural statements. For example, injunctions like, “One who desires heaven should perform the Agnihotra sacrifice” (*agnihotraṃ juhuyātsvargakāmaḥ*), which promise results in a future life, would be meaningless if a self distinct from the body did not exist to reap those rewards. The very coherence of such scriptural commands requires us to postulate a transmigrating self. This is what is meant by *śrutārthāpatti*.

Second, the text also mentions direct scriptural statements (*śrutibhiḥ*). Here, an interesting objection arises. Usually, postulation from a perceived fact (*dṛṣṭārthāpatti*) is explained with the example: "The fact that the healthy Devadatta is fat, despite not eating during the day, is inexplicable without postulating that he eats at night." In that case, the fatness is a "seen fact" (*dṛṣṭo'rthaḥ*). But how can you classify a *śruti*—which is a verbal text—as a "seen fact"?

The answer is this: While for ordinary people that may be the definition, for followers of the Veda, scripture (*śruti*) itself is a divine eye (*divyaṃ cakṣuḥ*). Indeed, we see this principle applied by the authors of the philosophical systems themselves. For example, in the Brahma Sūtras (3.1.8), the text reads *dṛṣṭasmṛtibhyām* ("from what is seen and from tradition"), where "what is seen" (*dṛṣṭa*) is universally understood to refer to *śruti*. Thus, the verse refers to both directly perceived scriptural statements and the inescapable implications of scriptural content.

The scriptures mentioned are described as "free from all defects" (*sarvadoṣojjhitābhiḥ*). This qualifier is added to highlight their unique authority, indicating that they are free from the suspicion of invalidity that arises from human authorship (*pauruṣeyatva*).

By these means of knowledge, for us Vaidikas (*naḥ*), in this matter (*iha*), the self is decisively known (*viditaḥ*). It is known as the embodied one (*dehī*), meaning the owner of the body and therefore distinct from it. It is also "capable of attaining other bodies" (*dehāntarāptikṣamaḥ*), meaning it is fit to take on other births and is therefore not perishable with this one body. Intrinsically, its nature is "consciousness and bliss" (*saṃvidānandarūpaḥ*).

The particle *ca* ("and") in the verse is intended to also include traditional texts (*smṛti*), such as the Bhagavad Gītā's statement, "This embodied self is eternal and can never be slain in any body" (Gītā 2.30), as well as scriptural texts like, "The two, the knowing one and the ignorant one, are both unborn" (Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 1.9).

It is important to note the context of this argument. Since this text is composed for its own community of thinkers, it appropriately presents scripture as the primary proof for the self's existence beyond the body. However, in a debate with atheists (*nāstika*), who do not accept the authority of the Veda, one cannot argue this way. In that context, inference (*anumāna*) must be presented as the proof. This is why other schools of thought formulate arguments such as, "Pleasure, pain, and knowledge are the inferential marks of the self" (Nyāya Sūtra 1.1.2), or "This self is to be inferred from activities like striving, just as a charioteer is inferred from the movement of a chariot" (Muktāvalī, Pratyakṣa section). There is no contradiction in employing two different valid means of proof for the same subject, and this will become clearer in the following verse.

But wait, let's first analyze this matter more closely. Is the notion "I am this" a delusion (*bhrama*) of the self in the body, or of the body in the self? In any case of illusion, three elements are required: a substrate (*adhiṣṭhāna*), a superimposed object (*adhyasta*), and a common characteristic (*sādhāraṇākāra*) that causes the confusion. For instance, in the illusion "this is a snake," the rope is the substrate, the snake is superimposed, and the common feature causing the illusion is their shared characteristic of being long and thin (*dairdhyādi*). In our current case, "this" refers to the body and "I" refers to the self. What could possibly be the common characteristic? One would have to say it is subjectivity (*pratyaktva*), but how can the inert (*jaḍa*) body possibly possess subjectivity?

To this, we reply: Our teacher specifically chose the analogy of the "red-hot iron ball" precisely because it works without a common feature. When an iron ball is heated until it glows red, people say, "This is fire." This is because the fire has completely pervaded the iron. Likewise, because the self (*jīva*) pervades the entire body, people naturally express the notion "I am this." In such cases of total pervasion, a shared characteristic is not required. The same principle applies in other cases of superimposition. In the statement "the crystal is red," there is no characteristic common to both the crystal and the red hibiscus flower placed next to it. The redness is simply imposed due to proximity.

The expression "the iron is fire" can be understood in two ways. For discerning minds who know the difference between the iron and the fire, it is a sophisticated, figurative expression (*āropa* or *aupacārika*). For the undiscerning who do not know the difference and see only a unity, it is a delusion (*bhrama*) arising from ignorance of the superimposition. Our teacher, by using the phrase "rooted in the non-apprehension of the distinction" (*bhedakākhyātimūlā*), clearly intends the second case—delusion—as the primary analogy here. One cannot simply claim that this refers only to ignorance of the conditioning factor (*upādhi*) but not to delusion. My good man, please clarify: what is the difference between a delusion and ignorance of the conditioning factor that causes it? The classic illusion of silver in a mother-of-pearl is also caused by a conditioning factor of similarity—namely, the bright, shiny form of the mother-of-pearl. In the same way, the perception of fire in the iron ball must be understood as a delusion. The unlearned, after all, know neither of superimposition nor of conditioning factors; they only have the raw experience. This is precisely why the Buddhists mockingly say: "Whatever is perceived by the senses is taken as reality. Thus, children are born as knowers of truth! What use, then, is the pursuit of true knowledge?"

So, if the identification of the self with the body is a delusion analogous to "the iron burns," its cause must be explained. In the analogy, the pervasion of the iron by fire is directly perceived. But how does the self—which is said to be atomic (*aṇu*)—pervade the entire body? You might argue that its quality, knowledge (*jñāna*), pervades the body. However, this attribute-knowledge (*dharmabhūtajñāna*) lacks subjectivity (*pratyaktva*). The experience "I, who am stout, am knowing" is an experience of subjectivity, not merely of an attribute. Therefore, how can this delusion of self in the body arise?

We will examine these profound experiences in detail later in the section on the theory of error (*akhyāti*). For now, the text clearly states that the notion "I am this" arises from the pervasion of consciousness (*caitanya*) throughout the body, just as fire pervades the iron. The essential subjectivity of the self (*pratyagātmatattvam*), residing deep within, extends outward through the intellect, mind, senses, vital breath, and body, generating the "I"-notion in all of them. Thus, that entity whose extension makes other things appear subjective is itself inherently subjective (*sahajam*); in everything else, subjectivity is derivative, caused by this conditioning factor (*aupādhikam*). Therefore, the subjective consciousness, pervading and assuming the form of the body, is the cause of the "I"-notion, which for the wise is analogous to the expression "the iron burns." This also explains why, even with our eyes closed, the body appears to us directly. The physical body itself cannot be what is shining, for it is inert (*jaḍa*) and external. Nor can this be a purely mental cognition, as the mind cannot independently access external objects. It must therefore be the subjective consciousness of the self (*pratyagātmacaitanya*) that is the cause of the "I"-notion everywhere in the body.

But what about the objection that it is the attribute-consciousness that pervades the body, and this consciousness lacks subjectivity? Our teacher will address this point more fully in the fourth verse, so we will examine it in detail there. For now, we can say that this consciousness, when it takes on the form of the body, is self-luminous and partakes of subjectivity, and therefore the body it pervades necessarily appears subjective, just as the iron appears to be fire.

Alternatively, consider the vital breath (*prāṇa*), which undeniably pervades the entire body. Its primacy among the conditioning factors for the self's empirical existence is universally accepted, as stated in scripture: "The vital breath is the self of consciousness" (*prāṇa eva prajñātmā*, Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 3.9). Since the "I-substance" (*ahamartha*) pervades the vital breath, and through it pervades the entire body, the "I"-notion in the body can be said to be conditioned by the vital breath.

Or, why be so hesitant? The five elements themselves are conditioning factors (*upādhi*) of the self. Therefore, the body, being composed of these elements, is naturally pervaded by the "I-substance."

In reality, the matter is simpler. Even for those who clearly know that it is only the fire that burns and not the iron, the expression "the iron burns" (*ayo dahati*) is seen as natural and unavoidable, because fire cannot exist without a substrate. Even those who have complete mastery over language deliberately use figurative expressions like "the village is on the Gaṅgā" or "the man from Vāhika is an ox" to convey a specific intended meaning. Even the all-knowing, all-wise Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "I will speak" (*ahaṃ vakṣyāmi*), not "My mouth will speak." If you object that this is Vyāsa's speech, not Kṛṣṇa's, then what stubbornness! Let it be so. Did Śrī Vyāsa, the all-knowing incarnation of Nārāyaṇa's power, know that Śrī Kṛṣṇa, abiding in a human form, was distinct from his body or not? If he did not know, then you, the chief of all fools, have saved the entire heritage of India! If he did know, then why would he write "The Blessed Lord said" (*bhagavānuvāca*)? He should have written, "The mouth of the Blessed Lord said." If you argue that the Lord says "I" because the effort to speak originates in the self, then you are conceding that the expression is figurative (*aupacārika*).

Furthermore, how would a knower of truth say, "I am going"? According to you, they should say, "My feet are going." And you cannot claim that the latter is the primary, correct usage while the former is merely figurative. What happened to the principle of using direct language when one has a choice? If you say this all applies only in the empirical realm (*vyavahārāvasthā*), we reply that since there is no transaction whatsoever in the ultimate state of reality (*pāramārthikyāmavasthā*), *all* expressions are empirical. This division into states is mere self-deception. What sane person would actually transact in the world by saying, "I am not going; my feet are going"?

Therefore, even for a knower of truth (*jñānin*), there are three distinct and valid modes of expression:
1.  **Referring to the pure self**: "I am consciousness and bliss" (*jñānānandamayo'ham*), or "I am Brahman" (*ahaṃ brahmāsmi*).
2.  **Referring to the distinction**: "My body" (*mama śarīram*).
3.  **Referring to the self as qualified by the body**: "I am speaking" (*ahaṃ vadāmi*), or "I am going" (*ahaṃ gacchāmi*).

Thus, even for the wise, the notion "I am..." refers to the self as qualified by the body. This is what the verse's use of *vā* was meant to signal. In the "iron burns" example, even those who know that only the fire-conjoined-with-iron has the power to burn, still perceive the glowing red iron as fire itself. The same applies to glowing embers. Fire is never experienced without a substrate. Thus, when they say "the iron burns," they are referring to the fire that has assumed the form of the iron.

Therefore, the conclusion stands: while the cognition "I am this body" does not establish the nature of the pure self, the self's existence as an entity distinct from the body is firmly established by scripture.

And as for the argument that since we perceive the co-referentiality of thinness and selfhood in "I am thin, I am happy" (*kṛśo'haṃ sukhī*), the body must be the self—this has already been refuted. We have shown that all three types of expression are natural even for the wise. For those who know that the body's stoutness is a cause of suffering and its leanness a cause of well-being, such an expression is perfectly legitimate. Given the unique relationship between the body and the soul (*śarīra-śarīri-saṃbandha*), this expression, while based on a conditioning factor (*aupādhikatva*), is not a delusion (*bhrama*).

---

Someone might persist: "So, is the cognition 'I am thin' a delusion or not?"

The determination of whether something is a delusion or not depends on the state of the speaker. It is not as easily decided as you seem to think, O Brahmin!

"What are you saying, great sir? That the determination depends on the speaker's nature? Does a donkey become a horse just because someone thinks it is?"

You are being childish. For someone who knows that the iron's power to burn is conditioned by the fire, the expression "the iron burns" is not rooted in delusion. In exactly the same way, for someone who knows the self is distinct from the body, the cognition "I am thin" is not a delusion.

"But if they know it is the fire that burns, shouldn't they say 'the fire burns,' not 'the iron burns'?"

Now you are not just childish, but foolish (*bāliśa*). Have you never seen the expression, "Devadatta cooks rice with firewood" (*devadattaḥ kāṣṭhaistaṇḍulaṃ pacati*)? Cooking is, by definition, contact with a specific kind of heat (fire). So, one should really say, "he cooks rice with fire" (*vahninā taṇḍulaṃ pacati*). Why say "with firewood"? If you say the word "firewood" is used figuratively for the fire, then why would a learned person, who has control over their words, use a figurative expression? And it doesn't stop there. This usage is so natural that grammarians even accept the sentence "the firewood is cooking" (*kāṣṭhāni pacanti*) when the speaker wishes to emphasize the excellent quality of the wood. If you say that the word "firewood" is used because fire cannot exist without a substrate like wood, and the cognition is thus of 'fire-as-supported-by-wood,' then by the very same logic, the expression "the iron burns" is perfectly natural even for the discerning.

In just the same way, even for the greatest Vedāntins, since the self cannot exist or be transacted with apart from its conditioning adjuncts of consciousness, the expression "I am this person, Devadatta" (*ayamahamasmi devadattaḥ*) is perfectly legitimate and valid (*atyantaṃ prāmāṇikaḥ*). Only those who are "half-Vedāntins" (*ardhavedāntinaḥ*), and therefore fools, would make a show of their supposed knowledge by using strange expressions like, "I am not doing it; my body is doing it."

Therefore, from the perspective of the pure self, the expression "I am thin, I am happy" is figurative (*aupacārika*), just as the expression "the man from Vāhika is an ox" (*gaurvāhikaḥ*) does not actually prove that the man possesses ox-ness. Similarly, expressions like "I am thin" do not prove the self is the body. Hence, the self is indeed distinct from the body.
