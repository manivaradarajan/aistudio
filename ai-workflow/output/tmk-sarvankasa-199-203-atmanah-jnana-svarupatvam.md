Of course. Here is an exposition of K.S. Varadacharya's commentary on Vedanta Desika's *Tattva Mukta Kalapa*, verse 75 and the following prose, translated into contemporary English according to the principles you have provided.

### Exposition of the Argument: The Self as Both Consciousness and Knower

The commentary begins by addressing a foundational challenge to the nature of the self (ātman). An objector, citing scripture, proposes a conflict: The *Praśna Upaniṣad* (4.9) describes the individual soul as the "seer, toucher, hearer... the doer, the self whose nature is consciousness (vijñānātmā puruṣaḥ)." If the self’s very essence *is* consciousness, the objector argues, then it cannot also be a knower (jñātṛ)—that is, a substrate *possessing* the attribute of consciousness. This would make the claim that the self is a knower a contradiction of scripture.

Varadacharya responds that this interpretation misunderstands the scriptural intent. The verse in question, he clarifies, affirms that the self (puṃs) has a nature of consciousness (jñānatvam), but it does not assert that *only* pure consciousness, devoid of being a substrate, is the self. To claim that the self is merely consciousness and not a knower would violently contradict a host of other proofs (pramāṇa), starting with direct perception.

#### The Testimony of Experience and the Clarification of Scripture

The commentator first appeals to our direct, uncontradicted experience (anubhava). Everyone experiences the self in the form "I know" (ahaṃ jānāmi) or "I am one who possesses knowledge" (jñānavānaham). This immediate self-awareness establishes the self as a substrate of knowledge (jñānāśraya), a foundation that cannot be dismissed. This experience is never invalidated by a subsequent thought like "I do not know" in a way that negates the "I" as the subject of knowing.

The objector might then pivot to a different scriptural passage, from the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad* (4.4.14): "That by which one knows all this, by what means could one know It?" This seems to prohibit the self from being an object of knowledge (jñeyatvam). Since scripture is stronger than perception, perhaps the experience "I know" (which presents the "I" as an object of its own knowledge) is illusory.

This, the commentator replies, is another misreading. The passage does not deny that the self can be an object of knowledge. Rather, it denies that the self’s existence is dependent on being illuminated by *another* consciousness, in the way a pot is. A pot is inert (jaḍa) and requires an external consciousness to be known. The self, however, is self-established (svatassiddha) and self-luminous (svaprakāśa). The scriptural passage asserts this self-luminosity; otherwise, the statement would be meaningless. If one then asks how something self-luminous can also be an object of knowledge for another consciousness (as it must be to be knowable), the commentator notes this lack of contradiction will be proven in detail later. For now, he points out a devastating logical consequence of the objector's view: if the self is not an object of knowledge, it cannot be an object of valid cognition (prameyatvam) at all. And if something is not an object of valid cognition, it must be unreal (mithyā). Furthermore, the property of being an object of valid cognition is a universal affirmative (kevalānvayi)—it applies to everything that exists. How could it be denied for the self alone?

Therefore, the scripture describing the self as having the nature of consciousness does not negate its role as the substrate of consciousness. The *Praśna Upaniṣad* passage ("This is the seer...") is simply restating the self’s commonly known status as a knower (an *anuvāda*, or restatement of a known fact) in order to introduce the additional scriptural truth that its essential nature is consciousness. It does not cancel out the common understanding. If the objector insists that scripture cannot have its primary purport in something already known through experience, the commentator agrees. But, he adds, just because scripture isn't trying to *prove* something already established doesn't mean it *negates* that established fact. The correct approach is a synthesis (samanvaya): the self is, in harmony with both scripture and experience, both of the nature of consciousness (jñānasvarūpa) and the substrate of consciousness (jñānāśraya).

#### Resolving the Substrate-Attribute Problem

A more refined objection now arises: How can something whose nature is knowledge also be the substrate *for* knowledge? We do not see two things of the same nature in a substrate-attribute relationship. For instance, color does not inhere in another color; it inheres in a substance (dravya).

The commentary's response is that to establish the common property between the substrate (the self) and the attribute (its consciousness), we must define what "knowledge" means in this context. The common, underlying property (anugataṃ rūpaṃ) is this: **knowledge is the illumination of an object (arthaprakāśaḥ)**.

This shared property is then explained by distinguishing the roles of the self (ātman) and its attributive consciousness (dharmabhūta jñāna), also called intellect (mati):
*   The self (ātman) experiences the manifestation or establishment (siddhi) of **itself alone**. It is inherently self-aware.
*   The attributive consciousness (mati) experiences the manifestation (siddhibhāvam) of **both itself and other external objects**.

Because both partake in the act of "illumination," they can both be referred to by the term "knowledge." However, the objection that things of the same nature cannot be a substrate-attribute pair is resolved because the self and its consciousness are **not identical in all respects**. There are crucial differences:
*   The self is inward-facing and self-referential (pratyak).
*   Its consciousness is outward-facing (parāk), as it illuminates external objects.

While they share the quality of being luminous (prakāśarūpatā), this partial similarity does not preclude a substrate-attribute relationship. If any similarity were a barrier, then since all things share the property of being objects of valid cognition (prameyatva), the relationship between a substance and its quality would also be impossible. The key is that there is also a crucial difference (vaiṣamya), which has been shown.

#### The Meaning of "Mass of Consciousness" (vijñānaghana)

The objector presents his strongest scriptural evidence: The *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad* (4.4.12) describes the self as "a mass of consciousness and nothing else" (vijñānaghana eva). Surely the particle "eva" (only, alone) negates any other characteristic, including being a knower.

The commentator's reply is a masterful piece of exegesis. He argues that scriptural statements describing the self as *only* consciousness are intended to serve a specific purpose: **to deny that the self has any inert or non-luminous aspect (jāḍyaprasaṅgavyudasana)**. They establish that the self, in its eternal and unified nature, has no part that is non-conscious.

To prove this, he analyzes the famous analogy of the salt crystal (saindhavaghana) from the same Upanishad. A lump of salt, when dissolved in water, is salty through and through. There is no part of the crystal that is salty and another part that is not. The entire mass is uniformly salt-flavored. Similarly, when the scripture calls the self a "mass of consciousness" (vijñānaghana or prajñānaghana), the intended meaning is that the self-substance is uniformly consciousness. There is no part of it that is inert (jaḍarūpatā). It is a statement about the self’s *homogeneity*, not about the *exclusion* of attributes like knowerhood. Just as saying a salt crystal is a "mass of saltiness" does not exclude its other properties like color or form, calling the self a "mass of consciousness" does not exclude its being a knower.

Furthermore, the same passage describes the self as "without an inside" (anantaraḥ) and "without an outside" (abāhyaḥ). The commentator interprets this to mean that the self is non-inert (ajaḍa) both in its intrinsic nature (svarūpam, the "inside") and in its attributes (dharma, the "outside"). This implies that the self's attributes must also be self-luminous. If an inert attribute were to belong to a non-inert self, the "I" would be a composite of the inert and the non-inert, a position the commentator, citing the tradition's founder, rejects.

#### The Distinction Between Bondage and Liberation

This leads to a final, subtle objection. If the self and its attributes are all self-luminous, then a person in bondage (saṃsāra) should experience their self and all its qualities fully, just as a liberated soul (mukta) does. This would seem to erase the difference between the two states.

The commentator replies that the mere presence of the necessary conditions does not guarantee manifestation (bhāna). The manifestation of a thing depends on its own nature and any potential obstructions. He provides an analogy: a person with a biliary disorder (pittopahata) cannot perceive the sweetness of milk, even though the sweetness is present. Similarly, for a soul bound by karma, the full and complete manifestation of the self and its attributes is obstructed. Only a sliver manifests. The difference between bondage and liberation lies precisely in the degree to which the self's true nature is manifest. Therefore, the fact that the self's attributes are self-luminous does not eliminate this distinction; on the contrary, it is what makes liberation—the full manifestation of that luminosity—possible. The problem is solved by the force of the outcome (phalabalena): we must posit an obstruction (karma) to account for the experiential difference between the bound and freed states.

Finally, the commentator reinforces his point: The scripture's description of the self as a "mass of consciousness" should not be taken as a literal, physical description. The self is accepted in this system as being of atomic size (aṇu), but this is not like the atom of earth, which has a solid form. The true nature and "size" of the non-physical (aprākṛta) self are beyond our gross intellect and words. Thus, calling it a "mass" (ghana) is a conceptual device used to teach its uniform nature of consciousness, not a literal statement of its physical form.

In conclusion, the self is not merely consciousness but is also the substrate of consciousness—the knower. This unified view is supported by direct experience, is not contradicted by a careful reading of scripture, and can withstand nuanced philosophical objections.
