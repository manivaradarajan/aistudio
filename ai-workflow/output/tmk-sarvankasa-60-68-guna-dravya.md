Here is an exposition of the philosophical argument from K.S. Varadacharya's commentary, following the specified principles.

### **An Exposition on the Distinction Between Substance and Attribute**

#### **Part 1: Establishing the Distinction Through Recognition**

**Verse 8:** A very firm recognition (*pratyabhijñā*) of a single object arises from both seeing and touching it. Since an aggregate (*saṃghāta*) is impossible [for our opponents], this recognition establishes that the underlying object (*vastu*) is different from its color (*rūpa*) and other such qualities.

**Commentary:**

After defining the distinct categories of substances, Vedanta Desika begins his systematic examination of them. He starts by confronting the Buddhist view, which challenges the very foundation of this project by denying the basic division between substance (*dravya*) and non-substance (*adravya*), or attribute.

To understand this, we must first note the relevant divisions within Buddhist philosophy. There are four main schools: Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Mādhyamika. The Vaibhāṣikas and Sautrāntikas are realists who affirm the existence of the external world, though they hold it to be momentary (*kṣaṇika*). The key difference between them is that Vaibhāṣikas believe the world is directly perceived, while Sautrāntikas hold that it is inferred. Both also accept an internal stream of momentary consciousness (*kṣaṇikavijñānasantati*). In contrast, the Yogācāra school holds that only this internal stream of consciousness is real and the external world is an illusion. The Mādhyamikas, for their part, argue for the ultimate emptiness (*śūnya*) of all phenomena.

The present argument is directed primarily at the Vaibhāṣikas. They contend that the world is fundamentally composed of four types of atoms (*paramāṇu*): those whose nature is smell (*gandha*), taste (*rasa*), color (*rūpa*), and touch (*sparśa*). From their perspective, Earth is simply an aggregate of atoms possessing smell, taste, color, and touch; Water possesses taste, color, and touch; Fire possesses color and touch; and Air is characterized by touch alone. For them, space (*ākāśa*) is not a real substance. Crucially, they deny a distinction between a quality and its possessor. Based on the principle of "inseparable perception" (*sahopalambhaniyamāt abhedaḥ*), they argue that since a quality (like color) and the thing possessing it (the pot) are never perceived apart from one another, they must be identical. An object like a pot is therefore nothing more than an aggregate of its perceptible qualities—it is not a separate substrate *for* those qualities. Consequently, the division between substance (*dravya*) and attribute (*adravya*) is unfounded.

To this, Vedanta Desika replies with the verse, "A very firm recognition..." The argument unfolds as follows.

Consider a common experience: a person sees a pot (*ghaṭa*) in a well-lit room. Suddenly, the light goes out. The person then reaches out in the darkness and touches that same pot. The resulting cognition for everyone is, "I am now touching with my hand the very same pot that I just saw with my eyes."

This experience of recognition (*pratyabhijñā*) is undeniable and powerfully firm (*dṛḍhatarā*). Its implications are profound. From it, we must accept that there is some single entity that is the object of two different senses: the eye (*cakṣurindriya*) and the skin (*tvagindriya*). The eye perceives color (*rūpa*), but not touch (*sparśa*). The sense of touch perceives texture and temperature (*sparśa*), but not color (*rūpa*). Yet the recognition, "I am touching the very thing I saw," demonstrates that there must be something common that is perceptible by both senses. This common object cannot be color, nor can it be touch. It must therefore be an additional entity that serves as the basis, or substrate (*āśraya*), for both color and touch.

This substrate, perceptible by two distinct senses, is what we call substance (*dravya*). Its qualities, such as color and touch, which are each perceptible by only a single sense, are what we call attributes (*guṇa*). Therefore, the fundamental division between substance and attribute is an inescapable conclusion of direct experience.

**An Objection from the Doctrine of Momentariness**

Now, an opponent might object: "According to our doctrine of universal momentariness (*kṣaṇikatva*), everything is fleeting. The object seen in the light is one entity, and the object touched in the darkness is an entirely different one. The feeling of recognition, 'I am touching the *same* thing I saw,' is therefore an illusion (*bhrānti*). It cannot be used to prove the existence of any enduring object."

To this, the verse replies that the recognition is **"very firm"** (*dṛḍhatarā*). An experience is classified as an illusion only when it is subsequently contradicted or sublated by a correcting perception (*bādhakapratyaya*). For instance, the mistaken perception of a shell as silver is corrected by the subsequent realization, "This is not silver." However, in the case of our pot, no one ever has the later experience, "I am *not* touching the pot that I just saw." The recognition is never sublated. To dismiss an unsublated, universal experience as an illusion would render everything, including the pots and pans the Vaibhāṣika realists believe in, equally illusory. This would be an unacceptable outcome for them.

The opponent might refine their argument: "An illusion can also arise from a defect in the cause (*kāraṇadoṣa*), even without a later correcting perception. For someone with jaundice, the perception 'the conch is yellow' arises from a physical defect. A correcting perception of 'the conch is not yellow' is not needed in the same way, as the defect itself explains the error. Perhaps this recognition is a similar case."

We reply that this is not so. There is no known defect that would cause the specific cognition, "I am touching what I just saw." No one has ever experienced it as a symptom of a defect. Since this recognition is produced without any causal defect and is never sublated by a later perception, it cannot be considered an illusion. The term "very firm" (*dṛḍhatarā*) in the verse is meant to convey this unshakeable validity.

**A Final Objection on Aggregates**

The opponent might try one last angle: "Even if color is perceptible only by sight and touch only by the skin, perhaps when they come together in an aggregate (*saṃghāta*), the combined entity becomes perceptible to both senses, just as mixing lime and turmeric, neither of which is red on its own, produces a red color."

The verse anticipates this by stating that for the Buddhist, **"an aggregate is impossible"** (*saṃghātāderayogāt*). The very idea of "mixing" presupposes the stability of the things being mixed. In a worldview of momentariness (*kṣaṇikatva*), the thing that exists in one moment is utterly different from the thing that exists in the next. What, then, could possibly undergo the process of being mixed?

Furthermore, an aggregate is a coming together of parts in a single place (*deśa*) at a single time (*kāla*). But in the Buddhist system being addressed, there is no independent, subsisting reality of time or space to serve as a container. If the opponent were to concede an independent reality of space, then that very space, serving as the substrate for the aggregate, would be precisely what we call substance (*dravya*), thus proving our point. The phrase "an aggregate is impossible" thus signals that the very conceptual tools the opponent needs to formulate this objection are unavailable within their own system.

#### **Part 2: Further Proofs for the Substance-Attribute Distinction**

The argument is further reinforced by another line of reasoning, hinted at by the verse's structure.

Consider a single object viewed from a great distance. One might be able to perceive its general form—for instance, its height—but not its specific properties, such as its color or texture. Conversely, one might discern a flash of color but be unable to determine the nature of the object it belongs to. If substance and attribute were identical, then to perceive one would be to perceive the other. The very acts of perceiving the substance and perceiving its attributes would be one and the same. How, then, could one be certain of one while being uncertain of the other?

The common experience of seeing a distant upright form and wondering, "Is that a man or a post?" (*sthāṇurvā puruṣo vā*) is a case in point. Here, the general property (height) and its underlying substrate are perceived, but the specific distinguishing properties (those of a man versus a post) are not resolved. This uncertainty proves that the substrate (*dharmin*) and its properties (*dharma*) are distinct. Similarly, the illusion of seeing silver in a mother-of-pearl shell would be impossible if one could not perceive the general shiny appearance without immediately perceiving the specific nature of the shell itself. All these experiences are inexplicable without accepting a distinction between a thing and its qualities.

**Refuting an Alternative Explanation**

An opponent might propose: "The object is indeed one. We simply describe it differently—as 'color' when perceived by the eye and 'touch' when perceived by the skin—because the sense organs (*akṣa*) themselves are different. The perceived difference is projected from the perceiver, not inherent in the object."

This argument, however, is fallacious because it leads to mutual dependence or circular reasoning (*anyonyāśraya*). How do we know that the sense organs are different from one another? We know this precisely because they apprehend distinct objects: the eye perceives color, the ear perceives sound, and so on. The difference in the objects perceived (*grāhya*) is the evidence for the difference in the perceiving organs (*grāhaka*). But the opponent’s argument claims that the objects are known to be different because the organs are different. This is patently circular: the difference of organs is proven by the difference of objects, which is in turn explained by the difference of organs.

If we include the act of knowing (*jñāna*) in this circle, we get a three-part circularity (*cakraka*): the difference in knowledge proves the difference in objects; the difference in objects proves the difference in sense organs; and the difference in sense organs proves the difference in knowledge.

Moreover, this proposal fails to explain differences *within* a single sense modality. The eye perceives white, blue, and yellow. Since the perceiving organ is the same in all cases, if the object's distinctness were merely a function of the organ's distinctness, all colors should be indistinguishable. This is an absurd conclusion. The distinction between substance and its attributes is therefore established on irrefutable grounds.

#### **Part 3: Defending the Property-Possessor Relationship**

**Verse 9:** If a property (*dharma*) were itself without properties (*nirdharmaka*), how could it be fit for language and other uses? If it depends on another property, and that one on another, this leads to an infinite regress (*avyavasthā*). [We reply:] No. Some properties also function as property-possessors (*dharmī*). In careful analysis, a property's nature is to establish both itself and others (*svānyanirvāhakatva*). And when we isolate a property for analysis, its own individual instances become its distinguishing feature (*viśeṣa*).

**Commentary:**

The Buddhists and their followers raise a more abstract and powerful objection, attacking the very coherence of the relationship between a property (*dharma*) and its possessor (*dharmin*).

Their argument takes the form of a dilemma. Consider the property "blueness" in the phrase "blue pot."
1.  Is this property of "blueness" itself something that has no properties (*nirdharmaka*)? If so, how can we even speak of it? According to your own principles, a word can refer to something only if there is a basis for its application (*pravṛttinimitta*), which is itself a property. If a property can be designated by a word without having any properties of its own, then so can a substance. The basis for making a distinction vanishes, and we are led to a world of simple, quality-less entities (*nirviśeṣa vastu*).
2.  Is "blueness" something that *does* have further properties (*sadharmaka*)? If so, then to account for *those* properties, we will need to posit yet more properties, and so on, leading to a vicious infinite regress (*anavasthā*).

Their conclusion is that the entire framework of property and possessor is incoherent. It is far simpler to hold that "blue pot" refers to a single, undifferentiated reality.

Our reply is, **"No."** This objection is not valid. We accept the second horn of the dilemma—that properties do indeed have properties—and we will show how the infinite regress is avoided.

The solution lies in a more careful analysis (*atimathane*) of the nature of properties. Certain properties, like universals (*jāti*), have a dual capacity: they are **self-establishing and other-establishing** (*svānyanirvāhakatvam*). A universal such as "cowness" (*gotva*) simultaneously accomplishes two things. First, it differentiates its possessor (the cow) from other kinds of beings (like horses), thus "establishing the other." Second, it is intrinsically and immediately perceived as distinct from other universals like "horseness." It does not require a second-order property (like "cowness-ness") to make it distinct. Its distinct identity is self-evident in cognition; it "establishes itself." This dual function is a fundamental aspect of experience and halts the threatened regress in ordinary cognition. When we perceive a cow, "cowness" functions as a self-differentiating qualifier.

The opponent may press further: "This might work for the perception 'This is a cow,' but what about when you use the abstract noun 'cowness' (*gotvam*) itself? When 'cowness' is the subject of discourse, what is *its* property?"

The verse answers this as well: **"when we isolate a property for analysis, its own individual instances become its distinguishing feature."** When we use a term of abstraction (*niṣkarṣaprayoga*) like "cowness," the property that defines it is the complete set of its instances. That is, the meaning of "cowness" is defined as *that which inheres in all cows and nothing but cows*. In this specific context of analysis, the individual cows (*go-vyakti*) function as the qualifier or "property" of the universal.

Thus, the relationship is reciprocal but not viciously circular, because the cognitive contexts are different. In the cognition of a specific cow, "cowness" is the qualifier. In the abstract cognition of "cowness," the collection of all individual cows is the qualifier. Since no property-less entity is ever the object of a word, and the infinite regress is avoided through the self-differentiating nature of universals and the reciprocal relationship between a universal and its particulars, the coherence of the property-possessor relationship is saved.

*A note on philosophical language:* Many of these hyper-analytical problems, such as positing a property of "locatedness-ness" to explain "locatedness," are merely verbal constructs (*śabdavikalpa*), not reflections of reality. In life, we perceive a pot on the floor. The philosophical analysis that generates endless properties for this simple fact is a specialized, and sometimes misleading, use of language. As the Yoga Sūtra suggests, such verbal constructs are a category distinct from both valid cognition (*pramā*) and error (*bhrama*). However, to dismiss all distinctions as mere verbal constructs because some are, would be like interrupting a wedding recitation of "Be as firm as this rock" to remind everyone that the body ultimately turns to ash. There is a proper context and limit for every line of inquiry.

#### **Part 4: The Coherence of Inherence**

**Verse 10:** How can a property exist in a substrate that is devoid of it (*tacchūnye*)? But if it exists in a substrate already qualified by it (*tadviśiṣṭe*), this leads to the absurdity of self-dependence (*svādhāratvaprasaṅga*). Therefore, [the opponent concludes,] there is no attribute and no possessor. This is incorrect. The property's inherence is in the substrate-as-such (*dharmimātre*). For this very reason, the substrate is not devoid of it. Thus, neither of the stated fallacies applies. To deny this is to contradict one's own thought and speech (*svadhīvāgvihatiḥ*). Other such sophistries (*jalpāḥ*) are refuted in the same manner.

**Commentary:**

Finally, the opponent raises an objection against the very possibility of a property residing in or inhering (*vṛtti*) in a substance. The argument is again a dilemma.

In the cognition "the pot is blue," where does the "blueness" reside?
1.  Does it reside in a *blue-less* pot? This is a contradiction in terms. How can blueness be present in that which is defined by its absence?
2.  Does it reside in a pot that is *already blue*? If so, then blueness is residing in a blue-qualified entity. This means blueness depends on itself as its own foundation (*svādhāratva*), which is absurd. A thing cannot be its own container.

Since both options are logically impossible, the opponent concludes that the relationship of inherence is incoherent. There is only a single entity, not a substance and an attribute.

This entire line of reasoning, we reply, is **"incorrect"** (*ayuktam*). The dilemma is a false one, created by mischaracterizing the substrate. The inherence of a property like blueness is **"in the substrate-as-such"** (*dharmimātre*). That is, blueness inheres in the pot, considered simply as a bare entity, prior to any qualification.

By inhering in the substrate-as-such, the property *makes* the substrate qualified. Therefore, the substrate is not ultimately "devoid of it" (*tacchūnyatā na bhavati*), which resolves the first horn of the dilemma. And because the inherence is in the bare substrate, not the *already-qualified* substrate, the absurdity of self-dependence (*svādhāratva*) is also avoided. Both stated fallacies (*uktau doṣau*) are thus nullified.

To deny this fundamental structure of reality—the relation between a property and that which it qualifies—is to render all thought and language impossible. Every judgment and every sentence predicates something of something else. Thus, anyone who uses language to mount this argument is implicitly relying on the very structure they are trying to deny, falling into a direct contradiction of their own speech and thought (*svadhīvāgvihatiḥ*).

This same counter-argument—that the denial leads to performative self-contradiction—applies to all similar sophistries (*anye'pi jalpāḥ*) that attempt to undermine the basic, experience-grounded structures of reality.
