Here is an exposition of the philosophical argument presented in the commentary, following the specified principles.

### **Exposition of the Commentary on *Tattva Mukta Kalapa*, Verses 6-7a**

This section of the commentary on Vedānta Deśika’s *Tattva Mukta Kalapa* begins by concluding a point from the previous verse before launching into a foundational classification of reality (*tattva*). The argument proceeds through analogy, addresses objections, provides crucial historical context for its philosophical choices, and begins the rigorous process of defining its core categories.

#### **The Finality of True Knowledge**

The commentary first illustrates the nature of definitive knowledge with a classic analogy. When one sees a tall object from a distance, a natural doubt (*saṃśaya*) arises: "Is this a tree stump (*sthāṇu*), or is it a person (*puruṣa*)?" However, upon approaching the object and perceiving details like hands and feet, one achieves the certain conclusion, "This is indeed a person." Once this direct, perceptual certainty about the object’s nature as a person is established, it is impossible for the previous doubt ("Is it a stump or a person?") or an outright error (*bhrama*, "This is a stump") to arise again concerning that object.

In precisely the same way, the text argues, once the fundamental reality (*tattva-svarūpa*) of a thing is decisively and unshakeably realized, contrary notions like doubt or misidentification cannot recur.

An immediate objection is raised: This analogy seems flawed. Distinguishing a stump from a person is a mundane, external matter. One can achieve certainty simply by walking closer. How can this be compared to attaining knowledge of the true nature of the individual self (*jīva*) and the Supreme Self (*para*)? Surely such knowledge cannot be so easily acquired (*susaṃpāda*).

The commentator concedes the point entirely. "True," he says. "Who ever claimed that knowledge of the Self’s reality (*ātmatattva-jñāna*) is easy to attain?" He notes that scripture itself affirms its difficulty, as in the *Bhagavad Gītā* (2.29): "Even after hearing of this [Self], no one truly knows it."

However, difficulty does not mean impossibility. The commentator immediately adds that scripture does not declare this knowledge to be altogether unattainable. The *Kaṭha Upaniṣad* (2.1.1) states, "A certain wise person, seeking immortality, saw the inner Self (*pratyagātmān*)." Even more explicitly, it declares (1.2.23), "He is obtained by the very one whom He chooses." Therefore, for those fortunate souls chosen by the Divine, such a definitive realization is indeed possible. For them, the matter is settled, and the possibility of lapsing back into doubt or error is eliminated.

#### **The Fundamental Division of Reality**

Following the standard philosophical method of enumeration (*uddeśa*), definition (*lakṣaṇa*), and examination (*parīkṣā*), the text now begins its enumeration of the categories of reality by introducing and explaining verse 6.

Verse 6 begins:
> **Those who know reality (*tattva*) say that it is established as twofold, divided into substance (*dravya*) and non-substance (*adravya*). Substance, in turn, is divided twofold into the inert (*jaḍa*) and the non-inert (*ajaḍa*). The former [the inert] consists of the unmanifest (*avyakta*, i.e., Prakṛti) and time (*kāla*).**

This establishes the primary classification. Reality (*tattva*), defined as that which is uncontradicted, is first divided into two fundamental categories:

1.  **Substance (*dravya*)**: The substratum of changing states (*avasthāśrayaḥ*).
2.  **Non-substance (*adravya*)**: That which is dependent on substance (*dravyāśritam*). Examples include the three qualities (*guṇas*) of *sattva*, *rajas*, and *tamas*, as well as sensible properties like sound, touch, form, taste, and smell.

Substance is then further subdivided:

*   **Inert Substance (*jaḍa*)**: That which manifests only for another, being non-luminous in itself (*parata eva bhāsamānatvam*). This category includes:
    *   **Primordial Nature (*prakṛti*)**
    *   **Time (*kāla*)**

*   **Non-inert Substance (*ajaḍa*)**: That which is self-manifesting or self-luminous (*svato bhāsamānatvam*). This is again subdivided, as the verse continues:

> **The latter [non-inert substance] is inward-facing (*pratyak*) and outward-facing (*parāk*). The first of these (*pratyak*) is twofold, divided into the individual self (*jīva*) and the Lord (*īśvara*). The other (*parāk*) is eternal glory (*nityā bhūtiḥ*) and consciousness (*matiḥ*, i.e., *dharmabhūtajñāna*). Regarding this, some say the first of these [eternal glory] is inert.**

This completes the taxonomy:

*   **Non-inert Substance (*ajaḍa*)** is divided into:
    *   **Inward-Facing (*pratyak*)**: That which manifests to itself (*svasmai bhāsamānatvam*). This includes conscious selves:
        *   **The Individual Self (*jīva*)**
        *   **The Lord (*īśvara*)**
    *   **Outward-Facing (*parāk*)**: That which, though self-luminous, manifests for another (*parasmai eva bhāsamānatvam*). This category includes:
        *   **Eternal Glory (*nityavibhūti*)**: The luminous, spiritual realm.
        *   **Attributive Consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*)**: The consciousness that is an attribute of a self, through which it knows other things.

The commentator notes that some thinkers consider Eternal Glory (*nityavibhūti*) to be inert (*jaḍa*), but affirms that it is in fact non-inert (*ajaḍa*), a topic to be explored in detail later.

#### **Justification of the Primary Division**

At this point, a major objection is raised against the foundational division itself: "What kind of classification is this—‘substance’ and ‘non-substance’? By this logic, one could divide reality into ‘pot’ and ‘not-pot.’ This division is philosophically useless."

The commentator responds sharply, framing his defense in urgent historical terms. "You criticize this," he says, "without understanding the intellectual crisis of a thousand years ago." The argument is not a mere logical exercise but a necessary corrective to devastating philosophical trends. He explains:

1.  **The Crisis:** The philosophical landscape had been ravaged by relentless dialecticians (*haitukaiḥ*), namely Buddhists and their philosophical heirs, the proponents of an undifferentiated, qualityless reality (*nirviśeṣa-vādins*). These thinkers had, in the words of a traditional verse, "made a mockery of Vyāsa, dismissed Vālmīki, and cast aside Śuka and Bodhāyana," rendering the foundational texts of the tradition meaningless. Even the *Brahma Sūtras*, which were composed to establish a Brahman endowed with auspicious qualities (*saviśeṣa-vāda*), were reinterpreted to teach a qualityless (*nirviśeṣa*) Brahman.

2.  **The Consequences:** This doctrine had catastrophic implications. By denying Brahman’s qualities (*guṇa*), form (*vigraha*), and glorious manifestations (*vibhūtayaḥ*), it destroyed the basis for all religious life. If God has no qualities, praise (*stuti*) is meaningless. If God has no form, meditation (*dhyāna*) and worship (*arcana*) are impossible. If God is an undifferentiated absolute, divine attributes like compassion (*dayā*) and loving affection (*vātsalya*) are explained away. The world was left disoriented, deprived of a path.

3.  **Ramanuja’s Restoration:** It was to counter this that Rāmānuja established, with great force, the doctrine of a qualified Brahman (*saviśeṣa-vāda*). His commentary, the *Śrībhāṣya*, had this as its primary goal.

4.  **A Second Crisis:** Even after Rāmānuja, a new wave of radical skepticism from "a mere dialectician and polemicist" (a reference to the author of the *Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍakhādya*), whose thought was steeped in Buddhist logic, "reduced everything to ashes." In such a climate, merely reading the *Śrībhāṣya* was not enough.

5.  **The Foundational Need:** Before any spiritual practice (*sādhana*) is possible, one must first have faith (*śraddhā*) in a God who possesses auspicious qualities, a divine form worthy of worship, and glorious manifestations. To establish this, one must first embrace the thesis that **Brahman is not without qualifications, but is inherently qualified (*saviśeṣa*)**. These qualifications are precisely its qualities, form, and glories. Knowing these is what gives meaning to praise, a basis for worship, and nourishment for devotion (*bhakti-yoga*), as the *Gītā* (10.7) states: "He who knows in truth this glory and power of Mine is united by unwavering yoga; of this there is no doubt."

Therefore, the initial division of reality into **substance (*dravya*)** and **that which depends on substance (*dravyāśritam*)** is the crucial first step. It is specifically designed to establish a metaphysical framework in which a substrate (Brahman) can possess real attributes. It is not a trivial or arbitrary classification; it is the cornerstone of the entire *saviśeṣa-vāda* system.

To the further question, "Why not just divide reality into 'substance' (*dravya*) and 'quality' (*guṇa*)?," the commentator explains that the term *guṇa* is too narrow and technically loaded. Furthermore, some philosophies claim a non-difference (*abheda*) between a quality and its possessor. The term **non-substance (*adravya*)** is used precisely to be a comprehensive counterpart to *dravya*, encompassing everything that depends on it. The 'a-' in *adravya* does not signify negation or non-existence (*abhāva*), but rather a positive entity of a different order.

#### **Refining Key Terms: *Pratyak*, *Parāk*, *Jaḍa***

The commentator pauses to clarify the specific meanings of key terms within this system, as they differ from other schools.

*   In some systems, "inward Self" (*pratyagātmā*) refers only to the Supreme Self. In this system, however, since the distinction between selves is real, every self is a *pratyagātmā* from its own point of view. From the viewpoint of another, that same self is a "you" or a "he," and is thus also outward-facing (*parāk*).
*   Crucially, this means **being outward-facing (*parāktvam*) is not the same as being inert (*jaḍatvam*)**.
*   The definitions are refined as follows:
    *   **Inertness (*jaḍatvam*)**: Manifesting only *for* another (i.e., being illumined *by* another). It is non-self-luminous.
    *   **Non-inertness (*ajaḍatvam*)**: Being self-manifesting (*svato bhāsamānatvam*).
    *   **Inward-facing (*pratyaktvam*)**: Being self-manifesting *to oneself*.
    *   **Outward-facing (*parāktvam*)**: Being self-manifesting *for another*. (This applies to attributive consciousness and *nityavibhūti*, which are self-luminous but exist for the sake of a self).

#### **Defining Substance**

Finally, the text begins the process of formal definition (*lakṣaṇa*), starting with substance.

Verse 7 begins:
> **Among these, substance (*dravya*) is that which possesses states (*daśāvat*).**

A state (*daśā*) is then defined as **an adventitious and inseparably connected attribute (*āgantuka-apṛthaksiddha-dharmaḥ*)**.

The commentator meticulously tests this definition:

1.  The qualifier **inseparably connected (*apṛthaksiddha*)** is necessary to exclude things like a pot on the ground. The pot is an attribute of the ground, but it is separately existing (*pṛthaksiddha*) and can be removed without altering the ground's nature. A true "state" cannot be so separated.
2.  The qualifier **adventitious (*āgantuka*)**, meaning non-eternal or acquired, is necessary to exclude inherent, eternal attributes. For example, the self's eternality (*nityatva*) is an inseparable attribute, but it is not adventitious; it is the self's very nature. Thus, it is not a "state."

With this complete definition, all six substances qualify:
*   **Prakṛti** is a substance because it possesses the adventitious, inseparable states of *mahat*, *ahaṃkāra*, etc.
*   **Time** is a substance because it possesses states like moments, days, and years.
*   **Eternal Glory (*nityavibhūti*)** possesses states like spiritual realms, gardens, etc.
*   **Attributive Consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*)** possesses states like pleasure and pain.
*   **The Individual Self (*jīva*) and the Supreme Self (*paramātman*)**, though they do not undergo intrinsic modification of their essence, are also substances because they acquire adventitious and inseparable attributes in the form of connections (*saṃyoga*) to other things. Even if the individual self is atomic (*aṇu*) and not all-pervading, its connection to things like air qualifies as such a state, thus satisfying the definition.
