Here is an exposition of the philosophical argument from K.S. Varadacharya's commentary on Vedanta Desika's *Tattva Mukta Kalapa*.

### Part 1: Refuting the Doctrine of the Soul's Origin

The commentary begins by taking up and refuting the position of an earlier thinker, Brahmadatta, who belonged to a school of transformation-based non-dualism (*pariṇāmādvaita*). His argument, which Vedanta Desika characterizes as a "challenge from one who has not studied the Veda properly" (*anadhyetṛcodyam*), is as follows.

**The Opponent's Position: The Soul is Created**

The argument for the soul's created nature begins with a widely accepted scriptural premise: "Brahman alone is eternal; everything else, which is different from It, undergoes birth, persistence, and dissolution in It." This is grounded in authoritative texts like the Taittirīya Upaniṣad, which declares that all "beings" (*bhūtāni*) are born from Brahman. The opponent argues that this term, "beings," refers to conscious souls commingled with non-conscious matter. From this, he concludes that the individual soul (*jīva*), just like inert matter (*acit*), must have an origin (*janimān*) and is therefore not eternal.

This interpretation, the opponent claims, makes straightforward sense of other scriptural passages, such as "Prajāpati created beings (*prajāḥ*)" and "He brought forth the souls (*jīvān*)".

But what about the serious ethical problem this raises—the possibility of losing the consequences of one's actions and reaping the consequences of actions one never performed (*kṛtahānākṛtābhyāgamaprasaṅga*)? The opponent dismisses this objection by appealing to the beginningless nature of both the cycle of worldly existence (*saṃsāra*) and the flow of karma. Just as a seed gives rise to a sprout which produces another seed, this causal chain is eternal. Since a single soul persists from the time of its creation until the great cosmic dissolution (*pralaya*), the system of experiencing pleasure and pain based on its actions remains coherent within that lifespan. As for a soul's very first action after being created, it is simply instinctual, like the actions of animals, which are not driven by prior deliberation.

**The Refutation: Scriptural Consistency and Figurative Language**

Vedanta Desika, as explained by the commentator, rejects this view as stemming from a partial and therefore flawed reading of the scriptures. A complete study of the Vedas, along with their auxiliary disciplines (*aṅga*), would lead to a different conclusion.

The central counter-argument is that the soul's eternality (*nityatvam*) is established by hundreds of scriptural passages and supported by authoritative ancillary texts like the Smṛtis, Itihāsas, and Purāṇas. Numerous scriptural statements directly deny the soul's origin, such as "It is not born, nor does it die" (*na jāyate mriyate vā*), and others directly affirm its permanence, like "the eternal among eternals" (*nityo nityānām*). The Smṛtis concur, stating, for example, "Unborn, eternal, everlasting is this one" (*ajo nityaḥ śāśvato'yam*).

Given this overwhelming evidence, how are we to understand the scriptural passages that speak of the soul's creation (*sṛṣṭivāda*)? The commentator clarifies that these passages must be interpreted figuratively (*aupacārikī*). The "creation" of the soul does not refer to the origin of its essential nature, but to its association with a physical body (*deha*), which is indeed created. This concept of figurative birth can be extended. For instance, when a person undergoes the sacred thread ceremony (*upanayana*), they are said to be "twice-born" (*dvija*), which is a new status, not a new soul. Similarly, the blossoming of profound wisdom (*jñānavikāsa*) is sometimes referred to as a "third birth." The soul remains the same entity through these transformative states, analogous to how a single being evolves from an egg to a larva and finally to a wasp (*aṇḍa-kīṭa-bhramara nyāya*).

**The Opponent's Rebuttal: Which Texts are Primary?**

The interlocutor presses his case, refusing to let the matter rest. Why, he asks, should we not take the creation texts as primary and the eternality texts as secondary? Perhaps the soul's "eternality" is just a way of saying it lasts for a very long time, just as scripture sometimes calls the air "immortal."

Furthermore, he argues that the problem of karmic justice (*kṛtahānākṛtābhyāgama*) is not truly solved even by positing an eternal soul. The workings of karma (*karmasiddhānta*) appear to be riddled with inconsistencies; we constantly see virtuous people suffer while great sinners live in comfort. The doctrine, he claims, is "beautiful only until examined closely." Since accepting the soul's eternality doesn't fix this observational problem, there is no compelling reason to prefer it. Perhaps, he suggests, the order of the cosmos is maintained by some principle we cannot grasp, or by the continual creation of new souls.

In a final challenge, he points out that for Vedāntins, who are committed to the grand scriptural promise that through knowledge of one thing (Brahman) all things can be known, the non-eternality of the soul is actually the more logical position, as it supports the idea that only Brahman is the ultimate, uncreated reality.

**Final Resolution: Weighing the Evidence**

The commentator responds that for those with an attentive and unprejudiced mind (*avahitamanasām*), the single, consistent intent (*aikarasyam*) behind these seemingly contradictory scriptures will become self-evident.

The scriptural evidence overwhelmingly favors eternality. The passages that speak of the soul's origin are exceedingly rare and, importantly, do not appear in the primary cosmological accounts of creation. In contrast, passages that explicitly deny the soul's birth or directly affirm its eternal nature are numerous and unambiguous.

Moreover, the opponent's proof texts can be shown to have other, more plausible meanings. For instance, the word *prajā* ("beings") etymologically implies continuous generation, making it an unsuitable term for a stable entity like the soul. Another passage mentions that souls were created "with water" and "on earth," which clearly indicates a secondary creation occurring long after the initial cosmic manifestation, and thus points to a conditioned, or qualified, origin (*aupādhika*)—namely, embodiment.

Because these creation passages are better explained in other ways (*anyathāsiddha*), they cannot be used to prove the soul's absolute origin. The problem of karmic justice remains a stark and unresolved issue for any theory of a non-eternal soul. Therefore, the natural and consistent sense (*svarasa*) of the scriptures is that the soul is eternal.

### Part 2: Addressing Specific Objections and Defining the Soul

The commentary then deepens the analysis by addressing two very specific and powerful objections.

**Objection 1: The Incoherence of Karma**

As for the opponent's claim that the law of karma appears unjust, the commentator replies that this does not disprove the doctrine but rather reveals its profound subtlety (*atigahanatvam*). Raising such objections merely highlights either the system's complexity or the objector's own limited intellect (*alpaprajñatām*). Similar objections are routinely leveled against the existence and nature of God, yet theism has not been vanquished. The very resilience of these doctrines in the face of such criticisms testifies to their durability.

**Objection 2: The 'Mass of Consciousness' in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad**

A more formidable challenge comes from a specific scriptural passage (Bṛhadāraṇyaka 4.2.12), which states that the "conscious self" (*vijñānātman*), which is a "mass of consciousness, arises from these elements and perishes back into them." This appears to be an explicit declaration of the soul's origin and destruction, spoken by the sage Yājñavalkya and confirmed by him as the definitive teaching.

The commentator resolves this by making a crucial distinction. The term "conscious self" (*vijñānātman*) does not refer exclusively to the eternal soul (*jīvātman*). It can also refer to the **elemental self** (*bhūtātman*), which is the self identified with the body (*dehātman*)—the view held by the Cārvāka materialists. While Vedic thought refutes the Cārvāka claim that the body *is* the self, it does not deny the existence of a self that is *manifested in* the body and appears to pervade it.

This distinction is supported by the lawgiver Manu (Manu Smṛti 12.12), who speaks of three distinct entities: the knower of the field (*kṣetrajña*), the agent who performs actions called the *bhūtātman*, and the inner self called the *jīva*. It is this *bhūtātman*—the embodied, phenomenal self—that "arises from the elements and perishes back into them." Yājñavalkya's statement that "after death, there is no consciousness" (*na pretya saṃjñāsti*) refers to the dissolution of this embodied consciousness, not the eternal inner soul (*jīvātman*).

**The Nature of the Soul (*Jīva*)**

Having established its eternality, the commentator asks: who, then, is this "inner self called *jīva*"? Acknowledging this as a profound question with no easy answer, he provides a brief survey of the views held by other major Indian philosophical schools (Buddhist, Jaina, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, Nyāya, Advaita Vedānta, Pāśupata Śaivism) to illustrate the topic's complexity.

He then articulates the definitive position (*siddhānta*) of Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta:

The soul (*jīva*) is the essential referent of "I" (*ahamartha*). It is, by nature, consciousness (*jñānasvarūpa*) and also the substrate that possesses consciousness as an attribute (*jñānāśraya*). It is self-luminous (*svayaṃprakāśa*), atomic in size (*aṇu*), and constitutes the body of the Supreme Self.

In our current, unliberated state, the pure self is not what we experience in our "I"-cognition. Instead, we experience the self commingled with subtle non-conscious matter (*sūkṣmācit*). The true object of the experience of inwardness or "I"-ness (*pratyaktva*) is the pure soul alone, which yogis can perceive. In the state of liberation (*mukti*), the soul's nature, freed from all non-conscious elements, shines forth as the perpetual referent of "I." This "I"-ness (*ahantva*) is identical to the soul's selfhood and is never lost.

With this definition, the commentator makes a concession: if an opponent were to claim that the soul has an "origin" only in the qualified sense (*aupādhika*) of becoming newly associated with matter, this would be an acceptable position (*iṣṭāpatti*). The error of Brahmadatta was in claiming an *absolute* origin for the soul's very substance.

### Part 3: Four Absurdities of the Non-Eternality Doctrine

The commentary now turns to the next verse (17), which presents four logical arguments demonstrating the untenability of any doctrine of the soul's non-eternality. Each line of the verse refutes a progressively more sophisticated position.

1.  **Thesis: The Soul is a Momentary Stream (Buddhist View).**
    *   **Argument**: "If stability (*sthairyam*) in its own nature is not accepted for the soul, then activity for aims in this life (*aihikārthapravṛtti*) would not be possible."
    *   **Explanation**: If the self is merely a succession of fleeting moments of consciousness, the person who initiates an action is not the same person who reaps its fruit a moment later. This makes all goal-oriented behavior within a single lifetime irrational.

2.  **Thesis: The Soul Lasts Only as Long as the Body.**
    *   **Argument**: "But if it ends with the body (*dehāntatve*), then on the path of righteousness (*dharye pathi*), unconditioned universal engagement (*viśvavṛttiḥ*) would not be established."
    *   **Explanation**: This view avoids the first problem by allowing for a stable self within one life. However, it renders nonsensical all ethical and religious practices aimed at securing a favorable outcome in an afterlife (e.g., heaven). The innate and universal human impulse to engage in such practices would be entirely baseless. No rational person would undertake religious duties if the self for whose benefit they are performed ceases to exist at death.

3.  **Thesis: The Soul Lasts Until the Cosmic Dissolution (*pralaya*).**
    *   **Argument**: "In the view that it lasts until the end of the kalpa, teachings on the path to liberation (*muktimārgopadeśaiḥ*) are rendered useless due to their fruitlessness."
    *   **Explanation**: This view accommodates afterlife-oriented actions. However, it destroys the meaning of the ultimate human goal, liberation (*mokṣa*). If the soul is destroyed at the time of cosmic dissolution, then "liberation" is nothing more than self-annihilation. Why would anyone undertake the arduous spiritual disciplines required for liberation if the ultimate prize is their own destruction? The entire scriptural teaching on liberation would be pointless.

4.  **Thesis: Liberation is the Annihilation of the 'I'-Sense (*ahamartha*).**
    *   **Argument**: "Regarding [a state of selfhood] lasting until liberation as the fourth human goal, scripture is not favorably inclined (*anabhimukhī*)."
    *   **Explanation**: This is the most subtle view, which posits an eternal conscious substance but holds that liberation consists in extinguishing the personal "I"-sense. The commentator rejects this by pointing to scriptural descriptions of the liberated state, which portray it as a positive condition of a persisting self, one who "becomes his own sovereign" (*sa svarāḍ bhavati*) and "sits singing this Sāman."
    *   An objector might argue that the "I"-sense is merely the internal organ (*antaḥkaraṇa*), and what remains is pure, impersonal consciousness. Quoting Rāmānuja's *Śrībhāṣya*, the commentator retorts: "'Even if I am destroyed, some other consciousness called 'knowledge' remains'—for the sake of attaining that, no one will make an effort." All spiritual striving is motivated by the desire "May *I* be liberated" (*ahaṃ muktaḥ syām*). The liberation of some entity that is not "I" is not a goal for which "I" would ever strive. The "I" is the ultimate foundation of all meaningful action, and its destruction is the ultimate anti-goal (*apuruṣārtha*).

### Part 4: The Ineliminable 'I'

The discussion concludes with a rigorous defense of the "I" (*ahamartha*) as the eternal nature of the soul, distinguishing it from related but different concepts.

An objector cites the Bhagavad Gītā (7.4), where *ahaṅkāra* is listed among the products of material nature (*prakṛti*), implying it must be discarded in liberation. The commentator replies with a critical distinction: the ego-principle (*ahaṅkāra*) is different from the self as the referent of 'I' (*ahamartha*). *Ahaṅkāra* is a specific material principle that, in unenlightened beings, conditions the "I"-notion. What must be discarded is its manifestation as pride and conceit, not the fundamental "I"-awareness itself, which persists even in the enlightened and in the Supreme Self.

Another objection arises from the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, which gives separate instructions for *ahaṅkāra* and the self (*ātman*), suggesting they are distinct. The commentator explains this as a pedagogical device. The text places the instruction on the *ahamartha* between that on the cosmic ground (*bhūman*) and the self (*ātman*) precisely to teach their ultimate identity. The separate instructions reflect different levels of apprehension, not a fundamental difference in reality.

At this point, the interlocutor modifies his stance, conceding that the self is indeed the object of the "I"-cognition. He proposes that the true distinction is between *being the referent of "I"* (*ahamarthatva*) and *being the meaning of the word 'I'* (*ahampadārthatva*). He suggests that even the Advaita view, which rejects the ultimate reality of the "I," only means to deny that the phenomenal ego is the true self, not that the pure self lacks self-awareness.

The commentator triumphantly exclaims, "Aha! You have come onto my royal road!" This refined position, he asserts, is precisely the Viśiṣṭādvaita view. The "I"-cognition extends from the physical body all the way to the Supreme Self. In every instance, its core referent is the inner, conscious self (*pratyakcaitanya*). This selfhood-as-I-referent (*pratyaktvarūpam ahamarthatvam*) is never lost.

The exposition concludes with a final clarification of three key terms:
*   **Ahamartha** (the Referent of "I"): The inner self (*pratyagartha*), which is the ground of the "I"-cognition.
*   **Ahaṅkāra** (the Ego-Principle): A distinct metaphysical principle derived from material nature that enables the reflective assertion of "I." Only its aspect as pride is to be discarded.
*   **Ahampadārtha** (the Meaning of the Word "I"): The entity being referred to at the specific moment the word "I" is used.

Through this detailed, multi-layered argument, the commentator systematically dismantles the view that the soul is created, establishing its eternality and its essential nature as the ineliminable "I."
