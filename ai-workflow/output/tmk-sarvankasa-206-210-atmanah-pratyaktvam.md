### An Exposition of the Nature of Selfhood (*Pratyaktva*)

This commentary explores the precise philosophical definition of selfhood, or inwardness (*pratyaktva*), as understood in the Viśiṣṭādvaita tradition. The argument unfolds by examining and refuting alternative definitions, responding to a series of increasingly sophisticated objections, and culminating in a definition grounded in scriptural authority. The central thesis is that the Self (*ātman*) is the true and direct referent of the "I"-cognition (*ahaṃpratyaya*), and that this "I"-ness is an essential, irreducible feature of the Self.

The discussion is framed by Verse 77 of Vedanta Desika's *Tattva Mukta Kalapa*:

> Some define inwardness (*pratyaktva*) in a person (*puṃs*) merely as being the substrate of a cognition that has itself as its object. But since the Self’s self-established nature (*svatassiddhi*) is already proven, it is more fitting to say that inwardness is shining *to oneself*, by oneself. That very same Self, when cognized by others through their own respective intellects, is designated as ‘you’ or ‘this,’ and is thus apprehended from an external perspective (*pratyaṅ* ... *tvam ayam iti mitaḥ*). An object, whether inert (*jaḍa*) or sentient (*ajaḍa*), if it is perceived for another, is properly an outward entity (*parāgartha*).

The commentary begins by engaging with a rival philosophical school.

#### 1. Initial Definitions and the Problem of Consciousness

The argument opens by considering the position of schools like the Vaiśeṣikas, who deny that the Self is self-luminous (*svayaṃprakāśa*). They propose that inwardness (*pratyaktva*) simply means being the foundation or substrate for a cognition that takes oneself as its object (*svaviṣayadhiṣaṇādhāratāmātram*). In this view, when I think "I know myself," the Self is the locus of that act of knowing. This distinguishes the Self from an inert pot, which can be an object of knowledge but never the locus of knowing (*jñātṛtva*). A pot is never the agent in the statement "I know."

However, the commentator immediately dismisses this definition as insufficient. He points out that in a previous verse, the Self’s self-established nature (*svatassiddhi*)—its ability to be evident without depending on another cognition—was established by inference. To argue otherwise would lead to an infinite regress (*anavasthā*). Therefore, any definition of inwardness must account for this foundational self-luminosity.

This leads to a more precise definition. It is not enough to say inwardness is self-luminosity in general, because attributive consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*) is also self-luminous. Rather, inwardness (*pratyaktva*) is defined as **shining *to oneself*, by oneself** (*svasmai svenaiva bhānaṃ*).

This refinement introduces a crucial distinction central to Viśiṣṭādvaita. While both the Self (*jīvātman*) and its attributive consciousness are self-luminous, the consciousness shines *for the sake of* the Self. The Self is the ultimate beneficiary (*phalabhoktā*) of the illumination provided by its consciousness. Therefore, the Self is the truly inward entity (*pratyak*), while its consciousness, which serves the Self, is considered an outward entity (*parāk*) relative to it.

#### 2. The Objection from Intersubjectivity: The "I"/"You" Problem

An immediate and powerful objection arises: If my nature is to be an inward "I" (*pratyak*), then this should be an objective fact about me. Yet, while I experience myself as "I," other people experience me as "you" (*tvam*), "this person" (*ayam*), or "that person" (*saḥ*). These terms designate an outward entity (*parāktva*). Does this not imply that the Self is a confused mixture of inwardness and outwardness? This is the central claim of opponents who argue that the referent of "I" is not the pure Self, but a composite of the Self and the non-self (such as the internal organ, *antaḥkaraṇa*).

The commentator responds by clarifying that inwardness (*pratyaktva*) is inherently perspectival. The Self is inward **only from its own perspective** (*svāpekṣayā*). From the perspective of any other conscious being, that same Self is necessarily perceived as an external object. There is no contradiction here, any more than there is a contradiction in a single location being "here" to me and "there" to you. This perspectival reality does not compromise the pure nature of the "I" or imply it is mixed with anything non-conscious.

#### 3. Refining the Definitions: Outwardness (*Parāktva*) vs. Inertness (*Jaḍatva*)

The objector, however, is not satisfied and refines the attack. The new objection is: isn't being an object *for another* (*parasmai bhātam*) the very definition of being inert (*jaḍa*)? A pot is inert precisely because its existence is for the sake of a conscious observer. If the Self is also an object for another (when someone calls me "you"), doesn't this force us to conclude that the Self is, at least from that perspective, inert? This would lead back to the conclusion that the "I" is a mixture of the conscious (*ajaḍa*) and the inert (*jaḍa*).

Here, the commentary makes its most critical philosophical move: it draws a sharp distinction between two kinds of "outwardness."

1.  **Being an object *for another*** (*parasmai bhāsamānatvam*): This is mere outwardness (*parāktva*). A sentient Self can be an object *for another* conscious being while simultaneously being an object *for itself*.
2.  **Being an object *only for another*** (*parasmā eva bhāsamānatvam*): This is the definition of inertness (*jaḍatva*). An inert object like a pot shines *only* for a conscious subject; it never shines for itself.

With this distinction, the objection dissolves. The Self is never inert because it never shines *only* for another. Even when it is perceived by someone else as "you," it continues to shine for itself as "I." Therefore, while the Self can be characterized by outwardness (*parāktva*) from another's perspective, it can never be characterized by inertness (*jaḍatva*). The "I" remains purely conscious, even when it is the object of another's thought.

The commentator notes, as an aside for advanced discussion, that from an ultimate spiritual perspective (*paramārthatastu*), even self-luminous entities like lamps or even attributive consciousness (*dharmabhūtajñāna*) are sometimes classified as inert because their light serves another. But this is a different level of analysis, intended to subordinate all realities to the ultimate Self, and does not undermine the fundamental distinction made here for defining the nature of the individual self.

#### 4. Dismantling the "Composite I" Argument

The commentary now turns to the opponent's primary evidence: everyday expressions like "I am stout" (*ahaṃ sthūlaḥ*) or "I am lean" (*ahaṃ kṛśaḥ*). In these statements, the "I" is identified with the properties of the physical body, which is non-self (*anātman*). This, the opponent argues, is definitive proof that the entity referred to by "I" is a knot (*granthi*) of consciousness (*cit*) and matter (*acit*).

The commentator systematically dismantles this argument from multiple angles.

1.  **The Error of Common Parlance:** First, he dismisses this line of reasoning as based on the confused experience of worldly people (*saṃsāriṇām*), not the clear understanding of the wise (*jñāninām*). Such statements arise from a fundamental confusion of word, meaning, and cognition (*śabdārthapratyayānāṃ sāṅkaryam*). Quoting the philosopher Jayanta Bhaṭṭa, he advises, "O good sir, you should not place your trust in such things."

2.  **The Authority of Rāmānuja's *Śrībhāṣya***: The commentator invokes the highest authority, quoting Rāmānuja's famous critique. To say that the Self, which is established by the "I"-cognition, is *not* the referent of "I" is as self-contradictory and absurd as the statement "my mother is barren" (*jananī me vandhyā*).

3.  **Logical Analysis:** He challenges the opponent to clarify what "the Self is not the referent of 'I'" actually means.
    *   Does it mean the Self does not appear as an *object* in the "I"-cognition? This is false; even the Advaita school's founder, Śaṅkara, admits the Self is the object of the "I"-cognition (*ahaṃpratyayaviṣayatvāt*).
    *   Does it mean the Self is not an *inward* entity (*pratyagartha*)? This is absurd, as inwardness is its unchanging nature.
    *   Does it mean the Self is not denoted by the *word* "I"? This is contrary to universal experience, as everyone uses the word "I" to refer to themselves.

4.  **The Cause vs. Object Distinction:** The opponent might counter that even in the absence of the gross body (e.g., in other states of consciousness), the subtle body (*sūkṣmaśarīra*) is always associated with the Self, so the "I" must refer to the Self qualified by this subtle body. The commentator refutes this by noting that the subtle body is imperceptible (*atīndriya*) and known only through scripture. While its presence may be a necessary condition or *enabler* (*prayojaka*) for the "I"-cognition in an embodied being, it is not the *object* (*viṣaya*) of that cognition. The Self remains the sole object.

5.  **The Analogy of the Hot Iron:** The commentary culminates this section with a powerful analogy. The opponent's position is that the inert internal organ (*antaḥkaraṇa*) appears conscious and says "I" only because of its association with the Self, yet the Self itself is not the referent of "I." This, the commentator argues, is as ridiculous as saying that a ball of iron, which can burn things only because it is infused with fire, is a burner, but the fire itself is not. The very "I"-ness that the Self imparts to other things cannot be denied to the Self.

#### 5. Final Proof from Scripture and the Nature of Liberation

Having refuted the objections, the commentary provides the ultimate positive proof from scripture, citing the "Instruction on the Abundant" (*Bhūma Vidyā*) from the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad*. There, the sage Sanatkumāra, teaching the path to overcome sorrow, first introduces the ultimate reality as the Abundant (*bhūman*). He then explicitly equates this reality with the Self, giving the "I-Instruction" (*ahaṅkārādeśa*): "I alone am below... I am all this." Finally, to show that this is the culmination of the teaching, he concludes with the "Self-Instruction" (*ātmādeśa*): "The Self alone is below... The Self is all this."

The commentator argues that this scriptural passage decisively establishes that the true, ultimate Self is the referent of "I." The "I"-sense (*ahamartha*) is not a product of ignorance to be eliminated but is the very essence of the Self, which is to be fully realized.

The exposition concludes by drawing a final, subtle set of distinctions:
*   **The meaning of the word "I"** (*ahaṃpadārthatva*): The linguistic designation.
*   **The nature of being the referent of "I"** (*ahamarthatva*): The ontological status of being an "I."
*   **I-ness itself** (*ahaṃtva*): The essential quality of selfhood, equivalent to inwardness (*pratyaktva*).

This leads to the final, profound conclusion of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school on this matter: Liberation (*mokṣa*) is not the destruction or dissolution of the "I" (*ahamartha-vināśa*), but its infinite expansion and perfection (*ahamartha-vaipulyam*). The Self does not cease to be an "I"; it realizes its true, boundless nature as an "I."
