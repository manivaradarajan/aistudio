# The Paradox of Multiple Conclusions

Our text announces its intention to explore "various conclusive doctrines." But observe: this very formulation generates a logical difficulty demanding our careful attention. The problem is not trivial—it threatens the coherence of systematic philosophy itself.

## The Essential Contradiction

Consider what we mean by "conclusive doctrine" (*siddhanta*). The term itself denotes finality—a determination reached through inquiry that admits no further revision. The defining mark of such a conclusion is precisely this: it cannot be reconsidered without ceasing to be a conclusion at all. When we have truly concluded something, the matter is settled.

Yet here we speak of *multiple* such conclusions. How can this be? If reality is one, and if philosophical inquiry aims at truth about reality, should there not be one conclusion, not many? Multiple conclusions would seem to indicate either that none has genuinely reached finality, or that reality itself fractures in some incoherent fashion.

## The First Response: Conceptual Overlay

A familiar verse presents an initial defense:

*"To a wandering ascetic, a lustful person, and a dog, one and the same human body appears as a corpse, an object of desire, and food—thus three different conceptualizations."*

This shows that a single object can support multiple conceptual interpretations. Different mental frameworks project different significances onto the same underlying reality.

Perhaps, then, multiple philosophical conclusions simply reflect different legitimate ways of conceptualizing what is fundamentally one. The plurality would lie in our ways of thinking, not in reality itself.

## The Objection: Opinion Versus Conclusion

But wait—this defense fails to address the real difficulty. The verse about the three observers demonstrates only that different *opinions* (mata) can arise regarding a single thing. These are subjective responses shaped by differing desires and dispositions. They do not constitute *conclusions* in our technical sense—settled determinations arrived at through valid means of knowledge.

We must not confuse these categories. Opinions may proliferate indefinitely based on perspective, temperament, or interest. But conclusions purport to track the actual structure of reality, and reality does not accommodate contradictory determinations. Are we to treat *siddhanta* and *mata* as synonyms? Surely this would evacuate the former term of all its distinctive philosophical content.

So our question returns with renewed force: if philosophers claim to have reached genuine conclusions—not mere personal opinions—how can these conclusions be multiple? What justifies using the plural form at all?

## An Apparent Impasse

At this juncture, let me address our imagined interlocutor directly. "What should we do?" you ask, puzzled. Kind friend, we are not asking *you*—your understanding is still developing. Stand aside for a moment while we address those more sophisticated thinkers who really should know better.

You see, this problem is genuine and deep. Even accomplished scholars often fail to think through this issue with sufficient rigor. The solution will require more than superficial harmonization.

## The Key Insight: Levels of Material Causation

Let us return to that verse itself and examine it more carefully. What does "one" mean when we speak of "one human body"? The verse asserts unity, but singleness itself is a property, a determination. Is this property also merely conceptually imposed? And what of humanity, embodiment, and the other characteristics that make this thing identifiable at all?

Think carefully now. These determinations cannot all be mere conceptual overlays, for they constitute the very basis upon which the differing conceptual overlays rest. There must be real properties, grounded in beginningless dispositions (*anādi-vāsanā*), that provide the substrate for higher-level conceptual activity. But if this is so, then these lower-level determinations cannot themselves be explained as products of the very conceptual activity they ground. Otherwise we face either infinite regress or vicious circularity.

Let us try a different example: a single lump of clay serves as the material cause for various artifacts—pots, dishes, decorative pieces. These manifestly different forms all arise from one material substrate. This seems to support the view that multiplicity is merely apparent, overlaid on underlying unity.

But consider the rejoinder: if one lump of clay can be material cause for multiple artifacts, why cannot one pot be material cause for cloth, walls, and other entirely different items? Obviously it cannot. Pots and cloths do not share a single immediate material cause. The relationship between clay and pot differs fundamentally from any supposed relationship between pot and cloth.

## The Crucial Distinction: Immediate Versus Remote Causation

Yet this objection succeeds too well. Clay and pot do stand in a special relationship that pot and cloth do not. I grant this readily, but insist on a refinement. When discussing material causation, we must not focus on the particular form ("lump") but on the material itself ("clay"). Clay as such persists through the transformation into pot—observe how we continue to speak of a "clay pot." The lump-form, by contrast, is precisely what is negated in the transformation.

This opens a critical possibility. What if pot and cloth, though lacking a common immediate material cause, nevertheless share a more remote material cause? Clay pots and woven cloths both ultimately derive from earth, the fundamental material element. At the level of their immediate production, they have different causes and different natures. But at a deeper level of analysis—when we inquire into ultimate rather than proximate material causation—they converge.

## The Principle: Reality as Nested Levels

Here our ontological principle emerges clearly. The relationship between material cause and effect admits of different levels or scopes (*kakshyā*) of analysis. At one level—call it the phenomenal or practical level—pots and cloths are genuinely different things with different material causes. This difference is not illusory or merely conceptual; it is as real as anything in our experience.

But there exists another level—call it the elemental or fundamental level—at which their difference resolves into a more basic unity. Both are modifications of earth-element. And sacred texts indicate an even more fundamental level. The Upanishadic declarations speak unambiguously on this point: *"One alone, without a second"* (*ekam evādvitīyam*) and *"It thought, may I become many"* (*tad aikṣata bahu syām*) indicate an ultimate reality that is genuinely one yet also genuinely becomes many.

Grasp this carefully: these levels do not cancel each other out. The unity at the fundamental level does not render the multiplicity at the phenomenal level unreal, nor does phenomenal multiplicity disprove fundamental unity. Rather, reality exhibits a nested structure in which different levels of analysis reveal different but compatible truths.

## Application to Philosophical Systems

Once we grasp this ontological principle, our initial paradox dissolves. Just as clay remains the material substrate whether it takes the form of pot or dish, and just as earth remains the ultimate material substrate for both clay vessels and woven cloth, so too philosophical conclusions can be multiple because they operate at different levels of scope or comprehensiveness.

Let me state the principle explicitly: "In the realm of material cause and effect, even in the case of a single object, conceptual differentiations arise precisely through differences in level" (*upādāna-upādeya-bhāva-sthale, vastuni api vikalpo bhavaty eva kakshyā-bhedena*). Do you see? A given philosophical system may achieve genuine conclusion—may settle matters finally—within its domain of inquiry. It articulates real truths about reality as accessible from a particular perspective or at a particular level of analysis.

Other systems, operating with different concerns or investigating different levels, reach their own genuine conclusions. These conclusions need not contradict the first system's results any more than the truth "this pot is clay" contradicts the truth "this pot is not cloth." They address different questions or the same questions at different levels of generality.

Nevertheless—and this is crucial—not all levels are equal. Some philosophical frameworks penetrate more deeply than others. There exist higher conclusions (*para*) and still higher ones (*paratara*), each adequate to its scope but not to matters beyond that scope.

## The Supreme Conclusion

Only one philosophical framework achieves the supreme level (*parama siddhānta*)—that which recognizes both the ultimate unity declared in scripture and the real differentiation constituting experienced reality. This system alone harmonizes all authoritative texts (*sarva-śruti-samanvaya*) because it alone has the conceptual resources to account for the nested structure of reality itself. It is the qualified non-dualism (*saviśeṣādvaita*) that our text will unfold. "Where everything becomes one—that alone is the supreme conclusion, which is one" (*sarvam yatra ekam bhavati sa eva tu paramaḥ siddhāntaḥ ekaḥ*).

This does not render other systems false or useless. Each captures genuine truth at its level. The problem arises when adherents of a partial view mistake their framework's scope, claiming for it a comprehensiveness it does not possess. This is the real source of philosophical conflict.

Consider the image of blind persons examining an elephant (*andha-dṛṣṭa-gaja-nyāya*)—each grasps a different part and declares confidently what an elephant is. Each claim contains truth—the elephant does have a trunk, legs, tail—but none captures the whole. Conflict emerges not from falsehood but from the partiality of vision combined with the presumption of completeness. "Mostly," I observe, "the quarrels among scholars, even learned ones who see only one region, proceed according to this principle of the blind persons and the elephant" (*ekadeśa-darśinām 'andha-dṛṣṭa-gaja' nyāyena*).

## The Charitable View

Against this backdrop of partial understandings and unnecessary conflict, consider this remarkable verse from the Bhāgavata Purāṇa:

*"Everything stated by the wise is proper, since it is supported by reasoning—what could be improper for the learned?"* (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 11.22.25)

The divine voice itself declares this unity of perspective (*aikarasya*) among those who possess comprehensive vision (*samagra-darśinām*). The Lord himself says this (*bhagavān eva āha*)! When one understands how different philosophical systems occupy different levels in the nested structure of truth, one recognizes that they need not contradict one another. Each has its place; each articulates something genuine about reality from its particular vantage point.

Now, do not misunderstand me. This is not some lazy relativism that declares all views equally valid regardless of their coherence or scope. The hierarchy remains: some views penetrate further than others, some frameworks prove more comprehensive, and one system alone achieves the supreme synthesis. But the existence of this hierarchy does not require dismissing everything below the summit as simply false.

## The Role of Critique

This framework transforms how we understand the purpose of philosophical critique. Refuting competing systems cannot be an end in itself, pursued for the mere pleasure of defeating opponents—we are not sophists (*vaitaṇḍika*)! Rather, critical examination serves two essential functions.

First, it establishes boundaries (*maryādā-pradarśana*)—it shows where a particular framework reaches its natural limits, beyond which it can no longer account for the full range of phenomena or harmonize all authoritative testimony. A system adequate for certain purposes may prove inadequate when pressed to address questions beyond its scope.

Second, critique serves to illuminate the nature of the supreme conclusion (*parama-siddhānta-svarūpa-pradarśana*). By examining where various systems succeed and where they fail, by noting what each captures and what each misses, the comprehensive framework emerges more clearly. The negative method—showing what the truth is *not*—complements the positive exposition.

We must proceed according to the principle *"not indeed through negation"* (*na hi nindā nyāyena*). Our method operates not through mere fault-finding but through careful discrimination (*vicāra*). We examine other views thoroughly to display the features of the supreme conclusion, not simply to score points in verbal combat like those whose sole aim is refutation for its own sake (*khaṇḍanaidam-paryeṇa*).

More on this methodology will emerge in the appropriate contexts (*tat-tat-prakaraṇe bhaviṣyati*). Our text will model this balanced approach: respectful of genuine insights wherever they appear, rigorous in exposing limitations, and always oriented toward the comprehensive vision that can acknowledge each system's partial truth while integrating all into a more complete understanding.
